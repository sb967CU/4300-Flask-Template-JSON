            "Great day trip $25 for the day\nGive you towels and key lock to use as a courtesy. Trainers look knowledgeable and helpful.\nWent in on a Monday and did my workout.\nLocker rooms are clean and loaded with shower towels.",
            "Good gym with friend staff. The personal trainers are nice and the equipment is good. The gym is in basement so there is no natural light.\n\nBe cautious and read the contract carefully before signing up because there are hidden fees around guests and other situations!",
            "The size of the gym is small, but the quality of this gym is top! Thank you very much for such a great opportunity to put myself back in shape! Will definetely visit you twice a week, and then let's see how it goes:)",
            "Definitely what it says it is - a basement gym. No frilly spa experience. \"Hardcore\" vibe - people who really train. Tons of cardio, clean and friendly service.",
            "Great small gym in the heart of SOHO. Friendly staff. All equipment that you'd want. I've been to gyms all over the US. This is a god one. Fast wifi. Very nice showers and locker room with full towel service. Not crowed at all when I was there mid day of a Saturday.",
            "Love this gym! Came in for a 2 day guest pass (along with 2 for my girlfriend, we got a great deal ESPECIALLY for NYC)\n\nThis place has everything you need: dumbbells up to 110lbs, ohio barbells, cable set ups, kettlebells, plate loaded machines, and stack based machines. It got kind of busy on a Friday morning, but Saturday morning was much better (we came right around opening though). Didn't have to wait for anything on either day which was great.\n\nAlso, some of the best Instagram worthy lighting I've found :)\n\nVery nice staff as well!\n\nHighly recommended",
            "Like a number of reviewers have already noted, the gym is small but it's clean, well stocked with plenty of equipment, and (in the few months I've been a member) never too packed. There's a dedicated deadlifting station, three power racks, plenty of dumbbells (the heavier ones are in KGs for some reason?), and a small studio for cardio/HIIT workouts or classes.\n\nThere's no cell reception, which for me is a plus as it keeps me focused, but the wifi is quick.\n\nOverall the gym is a great value for the price and way cheaper than some alternatives in the area. I switched from Equinox after being a member there for 5 years and don't regret it at all. The only reason it loses a star is because it's a bit of a pain to remember to bring a lock for the lockers.I constantly forget and end up toting some things around the gym with me.",

Don't expect a lot of classes or personal trainers prowling the floor. If you're inexperienced in the gym, there are other options for you. But if you're just looking for a place to lift, this is a really solid option.\n\n- Three power lifting cages, lots of dbs and kbs (db's are in kilos for some reason)\n- Machines, battle ropes, heavy bag, hex bar deadlift - they have a lot of stuff\n- Doesn't get too crowded\n- towels and showers\n- fast wifi (no cell service)\n- very reasonably priced with no-hassle month to month membership\n\nThe only place it loses a star is in the men's locker room, which is pretty cramped.

            "The price is pretty good, $165 a month, at this small gym but there are several issues that one should keep in mind. The aerobic area thermostats have been broken since last summer and the temperature inside varies from 78 to 80 degrees. I've asked management to fix them multiple times since last summer to no avail. I'm therefore sadly looking for another gym because one of the main reasons I go is to be able to use treadmills in air conditioning during the hot summer months and I expect a gym temperature to be no more than 70 degrees in the aerobic area, preferably 68 degrees.\n\nAlso I'm not too impressed by the outdoor space. A loud air-conditioning unit means there's a constant low buzz and the astroturf grass is less than charming. Also the sun hits the space full blast most of the day and there are few umbrellas.\n\nFinally the Musak in the club is constantly on even though literally everyone has earbuds or headphones on. The volume varies from a reasonable loudness to quite loud for some reason. I tried Bose earbuds to block it out to no avail and then bought $300 Bose over-the- ear noise-cancelling headphones to block it out, which was successful.",

            "This is my favorite gym. Reason is simple: tenant pay 100/Mon which is a great deal considering the environment and convenient. I personally enjoy the gym a lot. It's great!\n\nPool is clean. Equipments are clean as well. The vibe is energetic and the movement you walk in, you want to exercise and move around. Great gym!\n\nMy tips are avoiding rush hours! lol it's a bit crowded sometimes tho",

I'm therefore sadly looking for another gym because one of the main reasons I go is to be able to use treadmills in air conditioning during the hot summer months and I expect a gym temperature to be no more than 70 degrees in the aerobic area, preferably 68 degrees.\n\nAlso I'm not too impressed by the outdoor space. A loud air-conditioning unit means there's a constant low buzz and the astroturf grass is less than charming. Also the sun hits the space full blast most of the day and there are few umbrellas.\n\nFinally the Musak in the club is constantly on even though literally everyone has earbuds or headphones on. The volume varies from a reasonable loudness to quite loud for some reason. I tried Bose earbuds to block it out to no avail and then bought $300 Bose over-the- ear noise-cancelling headphones to block it out, which was successful.",
            "I've had a great experience at this club! The facilities and equipment are always clean, class instructors are great, and everyone on the staff is so friendly. I've used the spa facilities and had a wonderful and relaxing experience. I also worked with Jonathan for personal training and he was fantastic!",
            "This is my favorite gym. Reason is simple: tenant pay 100/Mon which is a great deal considering the environment and convenient. I personally enjoy the gym a lot. It's great!\n\nPool is clean. Equipments are clean as well. The vibe is energetic and the movement you walk in, you want to exercise and move around. Great gym!\n\nMy tips are avoiding rush hours! lol it's a bit crowded sometimes tho",
            "Beautiful ambiance. Great club. Location is a 6 on 10 though. The outdoor workout spaces are incomparable with regular premium clubs - incredibly good when weather is amenable. Equipment great, staff nice!"

            "Incredible facility. Excellent, helpful staff. I joined for the pool and to rehab after some foot injuries. Between the quality swimming and constant walking through Manhattan, I turned around an injury for the limited periods I could spend in the city. The Gym is open late and its not excessively busy. Some of the teachers are average, some are quite good. Yoga Foundations and Slava the swim coach are A grade. Stroke has improved.\nIts almost like a retreat space in that you could swim in a quality 25 yard pool then soak in a hot tub, then walk 10 feet to a veranda area overlooking the hudson and get a tan, or read, or hang out. Expensive but worth it in terms of health improvements, energy, recovery. A Citibike station at the piers would be a game changer! 5 real stars.",
            "I was a member here for many years and decided to rejoin after receiving a mail that I could rejoin at the current price and without an initiation fee. When I went to pay, they were charging me a \"deposit\" of $250 (which will not be applied to my current membership fee). This was never mentioned in the many \"please come back\" emails I've received. This is not honest marketing; no other gym does this. They l'll get it back if I decide to quit but essentially they're asking for a free loan. No thanks.",

            "Very upset about multiple billing errors, now 3 months in a row. I love the facility but this kind of thing is amateurish and unprofessional. In November, my account was blocked for non payment even though funds had been debited several days earlier. Last month, I was double billed. Today, my account was blocked for non payment again even though funds were debited. Each time has required me to call to complain. This was never a problem in the past - I've been a member since 2015.",
            "I love guys dearly, but your billing snafus are getting tiresome. A few weeks ago you blocked my account for non payment even through the funds had clearly been deducted a few days earlier. Today you deducted an additional $224 from my account on top of the regular member dues. I've sent a screenshot to fitness@chelseapiers.com. The receptionist assured me that this will be fixed, and I appreciate that. But this is not acceptable.",
            "The pool is terrible. It is cloudy and even though you have to register for a time slot, it's not respected. It can be super crowded. They don't always use certified lifeguards. In fact some lifeguards don't swim at all.\n\nThere was weeks where there was no hot water in the dressing rooms. For $3,000 you'd expect at least hot water. The front desk is nice but not properly trained. Also the music as you walk in is blaring.\n\nThe work out area does have new equipment.",
            "This is my happy place, a sanctuary of health and wellness, an adult playground I just love this place. I joined this gym in January and its the best investment I've made this year, im a shitty day trader so thats not saying much.\n\nThe Yoga studios are so peaceful and the instructors are all masters. Notably Jason Morris hot yoga classes are energizing and therapeutic, he is such a Guru Ive learned so much about anatomy and making a mind body connection that it spills over into weight training. Luliias voice is so soothing and her classes are so fun, the Friday class specially feels like everyone is connected Gigis class is super cool on Sundays it should be renamed Juicy Yoga with Gigi lol, shes so funny and connects with everyone, the class feels like cuddles after sex.\n\nSpin with Juggy and Melora is elite. Ive gotten so much faster in my road bike after just a few classes.\n\nFunctional training with Nyerre Mays is un-unreal. He is such a cool dude and such a Pro.\n\nThe pool is epic, the Jacuzzi forget about it. The entire staff is super friendly and makes everyone feel super welcomed. I truly feel at home whenever I make it to the gym.\n\nThe MVPs of the gym are the cleaning staff though, everything is so spotless all the time. In a city so chaotic is nice to have this peaceful oasis.",

In November, my account was blocked for non payment even though funds had been debited several days earlier. Last month, I was double billed. Today, my account was blocked for non payment again even though funds were debited. Each time has required me to call to complain. This was never a problem in the past - I've been a member since 2015.",
            "I love guys dearly, but your billing snafus are getting tiresome. A few weeks ago you blocked my account for non payment even through the funds had clearly been deducted a few days earlier. Today you deducted an additional $224 from my account on top of the regular member dues. I've sent a screenshot to fitness@chelseapiers.com. The receptionist assured me that this will be fixed, and I appreciate that. But this is not acceptable.",
            "The pool is terrible. It is cloudy and even though you have to register for a time slot, it's not respected. It can be super crowded. They don't always use certified lifeguards. In fact some lifeguards don't swim at all.\n\nThere was weeks where there was no hot water in the dressing rooms. For $3,000 you'd expect at least hot water. The front desk is nice but not properly trained. Also the music as you walk in is blaring.\n\nThe work out area does have new equipment.",

I joined this gym in January and its the best investment I've made this year, im a shitty day trader so thats not saying much.\n\nThe Yoga studios are so peaceful and the instructors are all masters. Notably Jason Morris hot yoga classes are energizing and therapeutic, he is such a Guru Ive learned so much about anatomy and making a mind body connection that it spills over into weight training. Luliias voice is so soothing and her classes are so fun, the Friday class specially feels like everyone is connected Gigis class is super cool on Sundays it should be renamed Juicy Yoga with Gigi lol, shes so funny and connects with everyone, the class feels like cuddles after sex.\n\nSpin with Juggy and Melora is elite. Ive gotten so much faster in my road bike after just a few classes.\n\nFunctional training with Nyerre Mays is un-unreal. He is such a cool dude and such a Pro.\n\nThe pool is epic, the Jacuzzi forget about it. The entire staff is super friendly and makes everyone feel super welcomed. I truly feel at home whenever I make it to the gym.\n\nThe MVPs of the gym are the cleaning staff though, everything is so spotless all the time. In a city so chaotic is nice to have this peaceful oasis.",
            "Incredible facility. Excellent, helpful staff. I joined for the pool and to rehab after some foot injuries. Between the quality swimming and constant walking through Manhattan, I turned around an injury for the limited periods I could spend in the city. The Gym is open late and its not excessively busy. Some of the teachers are average, some are quite good. Yoga Foundations and Slava the swim coach are A grade. Stroke has improved.\nIts almost like a retreat space in that you could swim in a quality 25 yard pool then soak in a hot tub, then walk 10 feet to a veranda area overlooking the hudson and get a tan, or read, or hang out. Expensive but worth it in terms of health improvements, energy, recovery. A Citibike station at the piers would be a game changer! 5 real stars.",

            "I have been coming to SevenBell Fitness and working with Gashford for the past couple months. I originally reached out to lose weight and get healthy, but I have felt challenged and encouraged to do more. Gashford's training sessions mix Muay Thai and regular weight lifting with some cardio. In only a couple months, I feel much stronger and have noticed increased focus and energy during the day after each session. He also has helped with meal planning and explains the science behind his workouts which i really appreciate.\n\nI've never really seen more than 10-15 people in the facility at a time, and as someone who hates big gyms, it's a super welcoming environments for complete newbies like myself. Perfect place and trainer if you're looking to mix up your workouts and create a real life style change!",
            "I've been going Seven Bells since I moved to Park Slope in September. It's honestly great how chill the gym is. The one thing I hate more than anything is having to wait for weights/machines and I never have that happen when I work out weekday evenings around 7.\nI got matched up with Sergio for person training and I couldn't have been luckier. I have issues from old surgeries and am prone to injury. Sergio is patient and has a background in physical therapy, so he knows how to set up the routine and modify things so I don't re-injure myself and end up not being able to work out for long periods of time. He's also good with schedules, communicating and just being fun to hang out with!",
            "I came to SevenBell this March to work on building upper and lower body strength despite living with a minor case of cerebral palsy. Upon taking a tour and listening to my goals, SevenBell placed me with Sergio who is a mobility expert and has experience training people with disabilities.\n\nIn the last 7 weeks working with Sergio, I've gained more than just muscle, I've gained confidence in my body and the strength I have inside and out. He continually finds new, creative ways to push my limits and I actually look forward to what he cooks up every session, so much so that I booked sessions with him through the end of the year. I can't recommend him and SevenBell Fitness enough!",
            "I've been training with Cam for the last 4 months. Cam is great: knowledgeable, patient, encouraging. I've had lots of back and mobility problems and had heard lifting might help, but was also really nervous about lifting because of those issues. Cam took the time (a LOT of time) to make sure I was doing exercises properly and improving my form every week - I never felt pressured to just crank it out any way I could. I'm way stronger now and it feels pretty cool.\n\nOther good things:\n- It's not crowded and I'm not waiting for equipment\n- If you buy a decent-sized package, the price is GREAT. Trainers with this much experience cost way more elsewhere and it's nice that the gym fee is bundled with the training.",
            "I started doing boxing and Muay Thai with Dino three months ago. I wanted to learn technique and Dino knows his stuff. As a coach, he's encouraging but also lets me know how I can improve my form. There's a dedicated boxing room where we work with pads, bags, and have recently started some light sparring which has been super fun and a great workout, both mentally and physically. Dino tailors the program to you, so if you're looking for more focus on a cardio experience he can definitely get you to sweat.\n\nI've been coming to workout at SevenBell for over a year and have enjoyed being a member of the gym in general. It's clean and I love that I rarely ever have to wait for a squat rack or machine.",
            "I joined Sevenbell Fitness and started training with Cam a few months ago. I have been through many different personal training experiences and every one of them have had difficulty dealing with my scoliosis.\n\nCam is different.\n\nHe never assumed to know exactly what would work because at the end of the day, how could he? Everyone's body is different.\n\nInstead, he took the time to assess me, encourage me down a certain path, gather the necessary data from said path, and adjust if need be. We tried a few different training modalities before finally landing on the perfect one.\n\nTo say this has been life changing for me is an understatement. Anyone who deals with scoliosis can attest to the pain and discomfort it may cause. Through weight training with Cam, I have virtually conquered that pain. The way my body looks is truly just a plus. And it looks damn good!\n\nI have never looked so toned. My body, especially my glutes, have never been more curvy and accentuated, and my strength levels are beyond anything I could have ever imagined.\n\nCam truly knows what he's doing and he does so in a sweet, kind, patient, but stern and motivating way.\n\nHis knowledge of nutrition is also something that I'll take with me for the rest of my life and has a TON to do with the changes I've seen in my body. He doesn't just teach you how to eat for muscle growth and fat loss. He teaches you how to eat for brain health, joint health, total optimization of the body and mind.\n\nLastly, Sevenbell Fitness is a totally private elite training facility with limited memberships only. What this means for the average gym goer is that you NEVER need to wait for machines or free weights and there are ZERO distractions when training here.\n\nThey use a reservation policy to ensure there are never more than five non-training members on the training floor at any given time. And usually there are only 1-3 MAX rather than the allotted five.\n\nFor anyone who's ever trained in a big box gym or just a crowded gym in general, you know how invaluable and amazing this is.\n\nTo get this level of training at the affordable prices they offer? I can't say enough about this place and have recommended it and Cam to just about everyone I know who has fitness goals they want to reach.\n\nThank you so much Cam and Sevenbell Fitness.

            "This is the place to be! Fantastic squat racks and an awesome community! It's hassle-free to go there because the staff doesn't hassle you, and independent trainers can work there comfortably. I have a special fondness for Mid City, especially Dave and Erin. Lift at a genuine gym!",
            "Really, really great-- clean, friendly staff and easy to get workouts done.",
            "Love this place, love my trainer, and love that masks are no longer required if you're fully vaccinated. The facilities here are nice, clean and equipment is on the basic side (nothing super fancy, no machines, etc) but gets the job done and then some. Also love that it requires proof of vaccination because it helps me feel way safer about my choices.",
            "I miss this gym! And Rob of course. He really knows his stuff... and how to kick your butt. During this quarantine, he's been willing to even offer video training sessions! I've enjoyed training with him this past year. He goes above and beyond to learn about my personal goals, problem areas, injuries and diet concerns. The targeted exercises we do during our hour are so helpful and I can really feel the results in my energy levels and flexibility. It's been a joy getting to know him and Damien, and I'm glad I can call Rob a friend. I highly recommend Encore Fitness as a beautiful training facility (OCD clean) and Rob as a trainer!",
            "This is a great place. I've been working out with Rob for around a year now. He's excellent, and the encore space is fantastic. It took me a long time to find a workout regimen that was as high quality and personalized as this, and I couldn't be happier with it.\n\nRather than just going through the motions of strength and cardio training, Rob also focuses on mobility and flexibility exercises, which have been really helpful. Rob deeply understands how the body functions and is very attentive to my individual needs and goals. Working out with Rob has made me much more mobile and I suffer much less aches and stiffness. It's really been a huge improvement.\n\nI've been especially focused on training specifically to get better at golf. Rob's understanding of flexibility and mobility has led to a huge improvement. He has taken a lot of time to understand what kinds of movements are important in the golf swing and what I can do to improve them.\n\nThe encore fitness space is extremely nice. It's definitely a high end experience that really feels like a private gym. Always few people there and immaculately clean. I've been doing zoom workouts with Rob since covid began, which have been great. Once the space opens back up I'd feel comfortable still working out there because it's a large area and typically few people. Easy to distance. In the meantime, the zoom workouts have been very helpful at home. Rob is good at body weight exercises and helping me stay flexible and mobile even though I'm not going out much. Highly recommend.",
            "Encore Fitness is fantastic. I've tried different gyms around the city, and this is by far the best experience I have had. The owners (Damien and Rob) are great, and they've built this awesome space that has everything you need to work out and a great, friendly vibe that makes you want to keep coming back.\n\nDamien (one of the owners) is the best trainer I've ever had. He's really encouraging, knowledgeable, and I always look forward to my sessions - they're fun, challenging, and I feel so good after them. I don't know how he does it, but he knows exactly how much to push and challenge in a way that feels incredibly rewarding. After our sessions, I'm always the perfect level of sore where I can still move, but also can tell that I've pushed my body in the right way. It's been exciting to notice how I'm getting stronger and my clothes are getting looser. He has even found a way to keep training me and offer remote sessions to clients while the city has been shut down.\n\nI feel like my life has changed for the better since I started working out with Damien at Encore -- it's the best investment I've made, and I highly recommend.",
            "I've worked with many trainers over the years, and Robert Lankard is the best.\nHis knowledge of functional anatomy, attention to detail, and overall professionalism are top-notch.\nMoreover, I never feel like it's just about the training sessions. He will check in multiple times with me during the week and make sure that my body is feeling ok, and that I've been eating right. If I can't make it in one week due to a busy work schedule, he'll craft a custom workout for me that I can do by myself at home. I feel like I've signed up with someone who is totally committed to my overall fitness and well-being.\nHighly recommend.",

He has taken a lot of time to understand what kinds of movements are important in the golf swing and what I can do to improve them.\n\nThe encore fitness space is extremely nice. It's definitely a high end experience that really feels like a private gym. Always few people there and immaculately clean. I've been doing zoom workouts with Rob since covid began, which have been great. Once the space opens back up I'd feel comfortable still working out there because it's a large area and typically few people. Easy to distance. In the meantime, the zoom workouts have been very helpful at home. Rob is good at body weight exercises and helping me stay flexible and mobile even though I'm not going out much. Highly recommend.",
            "Encore Fitness is fantastic. I've tried different gyms around the city, and this is by far the best experience I have had. The owners (Damien and Rob) are great, and they've built this awesome space that has everything you need to work out and a great, friendly vibe that makes you want to keep coming back.\n\nDamien (one of the owners) is the best trainer I've ever had. He's really encouraging, knowledgeable, and I always look forward to my sessions - they're fun, challenging, and I feel so good after them. I don't know how he does it, but he knows exactly how much to push and challenge in a way that feels incredibly rewarding. After our sessions, I'm always the perfect level of sore where I can still move, but also can tell that I've pushed my body in the right way. It's been exciting to notice how I'm getting stronger and my clothes are getting looser. He has even found a way to keep training me and offer remote sessions to clients while the city has been shut down.\n\nI feel like my life has changed for the better since I started working out with Damien at Encore -- it's the best investment I've made, and I highly recommend.",
            "I've worked with many trainers over the years, and Robert Lankard is the best.\nHis knowledge of functional anatomy, attention to detail, and overall professionalism are top-notch.\nMoreover, I never feel like it's just about the training sessions. He will check in multiple times with me during the week and make sure that my body is feeling ok, and that I've been eating right. If I can't make it in one week due to a busy work schedule, he'll craft a custom workout for me that I can do by myself at home. I feel like I've signed up with someone who is totally committed to my overall fitness and well-being.\nHighly recommend."

            "Ok... After being a \"founding\" member here at this Noho Lifetime location since it opened May 2021, it originally was a really wonderful gym, I loved it. Now it is going down hill at an rapid pace.\n\n1. The classes are supposed to be limited to a certain amount of members but no one monitors if members have actually registered for the class. One instructor invites the people from his previous class to stay for his next class... Regardless if they are registered or not. Some classes allows for 25 members to register for the class regardless of the fact that the studio is not big enough, there are not enough weights and there are not enough mats for 25 (or more) members.\n\n2. You can no longer reserve a specific spot ahead of time so setting up for the class is a free for all.\n\n3. Core class ends at 5:30 pm and it always runs over time.... The next class starts at 5:30 pm... Do you know what it's like transitioning the classes? It's absolute chaos.\n\n4. Apparently you can bring your camera in to the women's locker room and take \"selfies\"... I have seen the same woman 3 times in the locker room with her selfie stick and she told me it was OK because she is only taking selfies. Another woman was face timing her boyfriend in the woman's locker room until I yelled at her. I told management... They did nothing.\n\n3. You can set your own combination on the lockers but if you forget the combination you can go to the front desk and ask them to unlock your locker with the master key. Apparently the front desk was busy once so they just handed the key to whomever asked for it...Resulting in a member's locker being opened with the key and her property was stolen. After that incident the front desk apparently handed out the key again to another member... WTF?\n\nI have written a letter of complaint to the corporate office and I have gotten no response. It's a shame, it was really a great gym when I first joined, now I'm afraid my shit could get stolen, someone could take a photo of me changing in the locker room and post it on the internet and the classes are so over crowded... If I'm lucky enough to get a space and some weights... I have to worry someone might slam into me or drop a weight on my foot... And membership is EXPENSIVE!\n\nIt really is such a shame. I really wish corporate would actually take an interest and fix these problems. It really was a great gym when it opened.",
            "Thanks, Et D., for such positive feedback! We are so glad to hear you have had an amazing experience and decided to stay a part of the Life Time family",
            "I had been a member of New York Health and Racquet Club for years, so I was already familiar with the Cooper Square location.\nWhen NYHRC went out of business, they offered members the option of rolling their remaining membership over to the Life Time Gym at the same location. I figured in a year, when my membership was up, I would just find another less luxurious gym.\n\nSo when my year was almost up at Life Time Gym, I started to check out other gyms in the city and I was absolutely horrified by what was out there. Gyms in windowless basements. Wait time to use equipment.\nTrying to register for classes that are already full a week in advance. Dirty workout spaces. Old equipment.\nLocker rooms where almost every locker had a lock on it yet the gym was almost empty. Lockers the size of a shoe box.\n\n\nLife Time Gym is on the higher end price wise but the space is huge and filled with sunlight. (I understand this is one of the smaller locations)\nI have never had to wait for equipment. I have never had a problem registering for a class. The locker rooms are spotless. The lockers are huge and there are tons of them!\n\nAnd the gym staff, the management and the instructors... Absolutely the nicest people in New York! Friendly, helpful, pleasant and positive!\n\nBelieve me I did my research and you will not find a nicer place to work out. No, it's not the cheapest gym in New York but it's definitely the best and worth the price. If I'm going to work out, I want to be in a place where I feel good and I'm happy to be there.",
            "Overall a pretty solid gym\n\nI had really big hopes considering this lifetime is the newest in Manhattan, so I was a bit bummed that it was a lot smaller than I expected. Everything feels a bit cramped and it feels more like a hotel gym.\n\nHowever all the machines and weights are brand new and the gym isn't crowded during peak hours right now. I came in at 7 and was able to get a great workout in without having to wait for anything.\n\nThe front desk staff are really friendly and welcoming. One thing I do love is how accessible this lifetime is to get to using the subway. It's a great gym and perfect for when you want a change of scenery from the lifetimes at sky and 23rd street.",
            "It feels very creepy exercising beneath a bunch of surveillance cameras (10+) placed throughout the gym.. and to pay almost $300 a month for the privilege.. I couldn't do it, and wouldn't recommend",
            "My gym, clean and nice. Staff is incredible, I always very excited to go, have also my locker there, my best floor is spa and sauna."

To be clear, I am sex positive, sex forward feminist, but this is so out of place and it's non sensical. If anyone at TMPL actually reads these reviews, phrase let the CEO know because there's no way he/she would have approved something so moronic and off brand.",
            "I used to come to this location when it was NYSC. Huge improvement! Nice gym with brand new equipments. Staff are welcoming and super friendly. They need a new bench though because the current one wobbles which is pretty dangerous. Other than that solid gym and would highly recommend.",
            "Hi there, thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a 5-star review! We are so happy you are enjoying your membership with us. We have relayed your message about the bench with our team.\n\nVery best,\nTMPL Team",
            "Love this gym. Super clean and never too busy. Staff is super helpful, Ashly and Edwin went above and beyond to help me workout an issue with my membership. They were super kind and accommodating.",
            "Maya, thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a glowing review! We look forward to seeing you in the club during your next workout!",
            "Absolutely unprofessional when trying to cancel a membership. I submitted my form almost two months ago and I'm still getting charged. I've reached out about this and have been ignored. I'm glad I joined a different gym."

            "305 is life! I'm so happy I discovered 305 fitness. I've only taken two classes that both have been exceptional and I will continue coming. You cannot pay me to get on the treadmill, so if I'm going to do cardio this is the way I'm gonna accomplish the task.\n\nIn case you're nervous about this being a room full of professional dancers, it isn't and you're gonna be fine. Everybody's just there to have a good time and flail around the music to the best of their abilities. It's much more about moving and pumping some cardio into your day so no need to feel insecure about your dancing abilities - you're gonna fit in and have a great time! There's also a DJ for every class which is a delightful touch that adds to the party atmosphere.\n\nThe AMENITIES! WOAH!\nIf you need to take a shower and get ready here, there are two showers in the women's locker room and they're full of Malin + Goetz products. They also have great hair products and a Dyson you can use with a diffuser if needed! The bathroom isn't huge so I could see it getting a little congested and stressful getting ready in the bathroom but wouldn't be a problem if you go during off hours.\n\nOverall, this might be my favorite fitness class I've taken in New York City and I will definitely be coming back regularly.",
            "You know a workout class is good when you're sore for the next couple days.\n\nThe workout class was right up my alley: music and dance. As soon as I stepped in, the staff by the counter greets us and are super helpful and friendly. Keep in mind they look for vaccine verification.\n\nThere's lockers and showers available. The locker area was really dark, with a water fountain station. And once you open a door, there's the studio!\n\nMy instructor was so energetic! I thought they would be calm from the reviews, but no no! Not only were they so motivating and fun, but the DJ by the corner mixed trendy songs to match their vibes. We pretty much do dance cardio moves to different pop music the whole class, with a yoga mat ab workout in between. I loved how the lights danced along to the music change. The instructor really embraces feeling confident and loving your body throughout the whole class, that you just finish your class feeling good about yourself.\n\nI'm so happy exercising and fun can exist in the same sentence, thanks to 305 Fitness. I would totally come back whenever I want to party but also sweat it out.",
            "Amazing space, staff & class. A good work out, tougher than Zumba but wayyy more fun. Good balance",
            "So fun! Go and dance your ass off! All the teachers know their stuff forward, backwards, and upside down twerkin on a wall! even if you \"can't dance\" (lies,) or don't get all the moves, nobody's judging, and we're all here to have a good time and fall in love with our hot selves. I'm dancing through some injuries, and lately have been modified AF.\nOh, and that cute little stash of orange ear plugs at the front desk? USE THEM!!! Here's to preserving our hearing in 2023, AND being fine as hell.",
            "My favorite workout, by far, and frankly one of my favorite activities in general. I truly can't say enough good things. Yes, it's an excellent workout -- you will be out of breath and sweating buckets -- but it's so much more than that. This place brings me up no matter how down I am when I first walk in. It makes me feel optimistic about life. It makes me feel happy to be a woman. It's EVERYTHING.\n\nI have been rooting for these gals since the beginning, and I know Covid was really tough on studios like this but I am so happy to see them succeeding and getting all these excellent reviews. Thanks for all the amazing classes!",
            "I love boutique dance studios and have been itching to find a new one since gyms have re-opened.\n\nMy friend took me to 305 Fitness. Since discovering this place, I've gone six times in about 2 weeks! It's not only fun, addicting, but also a real cardio work-out! It definitely helped that they have an amazing newcomers deal. You pay around 30 dollars for the all-you-can-use 10-day pass.\n\nThe class is a 45-minute cardio dance work-out with a short interval work-out in between the cardio that targets different parts of the body. It is not the typical dance class that I'm used to like DanceBody or Body by Simone. There is less choreography, but it is as fun, if not, more fun than the other studios. I always feel very empowered during and after these classes.",

What I liked best about the class was that everyone was of all different dancing abilities. I am a horrible dancer and can't move to save my life but I didn't feel judged or anything because there were others who also didn't know how to dance and were just there to have fun and get a workout in. 10/10 recommend!",

            "I'm sorry, but I don't get the five-star reviews and the cult following. I took a class here and I would never do it again. Granted, it was my first class at this location, but I don't think I'd like it more if I kept coming. It felt like I was just moving about purposelessly. This is an awful workout, if you can even call it that, and the instructor who shall not be named was even more awful. She literally asked people in class to spank her... I mean, what?\n\nIt's supposed to be a cardio dance class. I think it's more of a twerking class on steroids. There's not much of actual working out. There was five minutes of glutes moves, but that's not significant. I feel like they just included that part to be able to say they work on toning, but that's not enough to make an impact on your fitness. The rest of it includes lots of moving left and right, stepping forward and backwards, bending over and shaking your butt, and raising your arms up, all in a high-energy fashion. I wasn't feeling it.\n\nThe room that the class was held in reminded my friend and me of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and the fact that they have a DJ is hilarious. The showers are NYSC-level, and there's just two stalls. They do have body towels, disposable razors, q-tips, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and face wash, so I'll give them that. However, the actual class was just not worth my time and I wasn't feeling it.",

I am a horrible dancer and can't move to save my life but I didn't feel judged or anything because there were others who also didn't know how to dance and were just there to have fun and get a workout in. 10/10 recommend!",
            "Best workout class I've ever taken! amazing instructor, amazing studio and amenities, and the workout is SO HARD but SO FUN!!!! Don't think I've ever had this much fun burning 350 calories in 45 minutes before",
            "Love love love. Feel good workout of the century- 50 kickass minutes! Super fun and empowering. Always leave happy",
            "Amazing space, staff & class. A good work out, tougher than Zumba but wayyy more fun. Good balance",
            "So fun! Go and dance your ass off! All the teachers know their stuff forward, backwards, and upside down twerkin on a wall! even if you \"can't dance\" (lies,) or don't get all the moves, nobody's judging, and we're all here to have a good time and fall in love with our hot selves. I'm dancing through some injuries, and lately have been modified AF.\nOh, and that cute little stash of orange ear plugs at the front desk? USE THEM!!! Here's to preserving our hearing in 2023, AND being fine as hell.",
            "My favorite workout, by far, and frankly one of my favorite activities in general. I truly can't say enough good things. Yes, it's an excellent workout -- you will be out of breath and sweating buckets -- but it's so much more than that. This place brings me up no matter how down I am when I first walk in. It makes me feel optimistic about life. It makes me feel happy to be a woman. It's EVERYTHING.\n\nI have been rooting for these gals since the beginning, and I know Covid was really tough on studios like this but I am so happy to see them succeeding and getting all these excellent reviews. Thanks for all the amazing classes!",
            "I love boutique dance studios and have been itching to find a new one since gyms have re-opened.\n\nMy friend took me to 305 Fitness. Since discovering this place, I've gone six times in about 2 weeks! It's not only fun, addicting, but also a real cardio work-out! It definitely helped that they have an amazing newcomers deal. You pay around 30 dollars for the all-you-can-use 10-day pass.\n\nThe class is a 45-minute cardio dance work-out with a short interval work-out in between the cardio that targets different parts of the body. It is not the typical dance class that I'm used to like DanceBody or Body by Simone. There is less choreography, but it is as fun, if not, more fun than the other studios. I always feel very empowered during and after these classes.",

            "You know a workout class is good when you're sore for the next couple days.\n\nThe workout class was right up my alley: music and dance. As soon as I stepped in, the staff by the counter greets us and are super helpful and friendly. Keep in mind they look for vaccine verification.\n\nThere's lockers and showers available. The locker area was really dark, with a water fountain station. And once you open a door, there's the studio!\n\nMy instructor was so energetic! I thought they would be calm from the reviews, but no no! Not only were they so motivating and fun, but the DJ by the corner mixed trendy songs to match their vibes. We pretty much do dance cardio moves to different pop music the whole class, with a yoga mat ab workout in between. I loved how the lights danced along to the music change. The instructor really embraces feeling confident and loving your body throughout the whole class, that you just finish your class feeling good about yourself.\n\nI'm so happy exercising and fun can exist in the same sentence, thanks to 305 Fitness. I would totally come back whenever I want to party but also sweat it out.",

            "If you're looking for a thorough efficient workout, Krank has it. They have a perfect balance of consistency & changing up the workouts. You won't get bored. The owner Dan & all the coaching staff (shoutout,Miguel!) are very approachable. If you are open to it, they are knowledgeable & willing to help you achieve your fitness & nutrition goals. I enjoy the style of coaching, \"get to work\" mentality. They are there to correct your form & provide encouragement but don't crowd you with a ton of extra \"high-five\" fluff (though I'm sure they'd give it to you if you prefer that lol). Also, their admin Mgr., Rikki, is very helpful when it comes to figuring out a membership & payment plan. Definitely recommend trying out Krank if you're looking for a new gym, challenges, & results.",
            "Long story short, Krank is easily the best gym that I've been to in NYC. Have only been going for a couple months and have already noticed a huge difference in my strength, cardio, athleticism, and mobility. If you're in the area, I highly recommend at least doing the free 2 week trial.\n\nLong story long, I used to belong to a normal gym in NYC where I would alternate between going regularly and not going at all. When I was going, my workouts were pretty good as I feel I have decent understanding of athletic training (ex-college athlete and have previously worked out with other personal trainers). I would plan my workouts, always doing interval training in an effort to make the best use of my time at the gym. There's a few problems with interval training at regular gyms. Others would often be using the equipment that I needed, leading to significantly longer workouts than necessary (which often discouraged me from going in general). I also felt like I was causing a scene when performing more athletic jumping exercises. Lastly, it was difficult pushing myself in terms of the pace of my workout and the lifting heavier amounts when training on my own.\n\nAfter 2 months of not exercising at all, I began researching new gyms to join. I originally wanted to just join a better gym as I never liked the idea of group training. After reading the glowing reviews, I decided to do Krank's free two week trial. I had an introductory meeting with Dan where I explained my fitness goals (stronger, better mobility, more athletic, better cardio shape, and less time spent when at the gym). After one week, I was hooked, regularly attending both the Krank and semi-private sessions (45-60 minutes).\n\nBoth sessions begin with a dynamic warm-up to get you ready for the main exercises. Krank sessions consist of high intensity interval training and typically involve bodyweight, sled, and lower weight kettlebell exercises. These sessions are amazing from both a cardio and strength perspective. While you go at your own pace, the group dynamic makes you more likely to push yourself. The semi-private sessions are more focused on the main compound lifts -- bench press, squat, & deadlift. Similar to offseason athletic training, the program is carefully planned and split into different phases to maximize strength gains. Exercises in the earlier weeks will be lower weight with higher reps, whereas later weeks will be higher weight with lower reps. While less challenging from a cardio perspective than Krank, these sessions are where your strength gains are most visible as you'll begin to lift heavier amounts. Once again, the group dynamic is beneficial as a spotter allows you to lift more weight than you may be comfortable doing alone. I would highly recommend either Krank or Semi-Private sessions as they lead to both better conditioning and strength gains. They are both full body workouts with attention given to each muscle group. I would personally recommend a combination of the two sessions as they serve as great complements to one another.\n\nLast and most importantly, Dan, Miguel, and the other trainers are amazing. They're highly knowledgeable and you can tell that a great amount of time and care went into designing the workouts. They also provide attention and motivation to everyone in each session. If your form is wrong, they're going to let you know and help fix it (which prevents injury). If you're slacking, they're going to push you to do better. It truly is a great place to workout and I can't recommend it highly enough.",
            "Hidden gem. Amazing coaches, unique workouts (if you like kettlebell work this is the place!), great for learning to lift or improving strength. Best thing is the community of folks- all different experiences and super diverse in skillset",
            "Like everyone else, I lost access to my gym in the COVID-19 shutdown. And while I miss the in-person connection with my teachers, small gyms like Krank have really rose to a level few can with their online classes. I was directed to a free booty class they were holding the past two Saturdays, and I got more out of that 30-minute workout than I've gotten in 75-minute workouts elsewhere. It's worth pointing out that Danny, the owner, was able to make me -- and I assume the other 60+ people in the Zoom -- laugh all while kicking my ass.\n\nIt takes a special person to be able to properly convey the heart of their gym and its members through a video chat, and when we're all allowed to venture out of our home gyms again, you can find me at Krank Brooklyn.",
            "Thank you very, very much for the kind words!",
            "Before Krank, I exercised sporadically. Sometimes I would run or take a yoga class or work out to Youtube videos. But I did none of these things consistently. I needed to commit myself to care of my body and subsequently my mind. For me, exercise makes me a happier person. I sleep better and I'm less anxious if I work out routinely. I needed to join a gym to hold myself accountable.\n\nWhen I started Krank, I couldn't complete a work out. I stopped my assessment after thirty minutes because I felt like I was going to vomit and faint all at the same time. Now, I can complete an hour to an hour-and-half work out with no problem. The elevation of my stamina alone is staggering. I have energy that lasts. Also, I have muscles. Krank introduced me to weight lifting. I'd never held a bar bell in my life, but the coaches saw that I could excel and enjoy it. I've gained about fifteen pounds since starting the strength training.\n\nAs someone who keeps a pretty busy schedule, I like the programs at Krank because I'm not working out alone. There is always a coach there to tell me what to do, to look out for my form and therefore safety, and to push me to do more. Plus, it's fun. Krank is genuine community.\n\nObviously, I highly recommend joining Krank. I was someone who had never been part of a gym before. I'd never taken classes beyond a drop-in once in awhile. I didn't consider myself someone who enjoyed working out. All that is different now. If you're ready to commit to yourself, to give yourself a healthier and happier practice, try out Krank.",

            "Long story short, Krank is easily the best gym that I've been to in NYC. Have only been going for a couple months and have already noticed a huge difference in my strength, cardio, athleticism, and mobility. If you're in the area, I highly recommend at least doing the free 2 week trial.\n\nLong story long, I used to belong to a normal gym in NYC where I would alternate between going regularly and not going at all. When I was going, my workouts were pretty good as I feel I have decent understanding of athletic training (ex-college athlete and have previously worked out with other personal trainers). I would plan my workouts, always doing interval training in an effort to make the best use of my time at the gym. There's a few problems with interval training at regular gyms. Others would often be using the equipment that I needed, leading to significantly longer workouts than necessary (which often discouraged me from going in general). I also felt like I was causing a scene when performing more athletic jumping exercises. Lastly, it was difficult pushing myself in terms of the pace of my workout and the lifting heavier amounts when training on my own.\n\nAfter 2 months of not exercising at all, I began researching new gyms to join. I originally wanted to just join a better gym as I never liked the idea of group training. After reading the glowing reviews, I decided to do Krank's free two week trial. I had an introductory meeting with Dan where I explained my fitness goals (stronger, better mobility, more athletic, better cardio shape, and less time spent when at the gym). After one week, I was hooked, regularly attending both the Krank and semi-private sessions (45-60 minutes).\n\nBoth sessions begin with a dynamic warm-up to get you ready for the main exercises. Krank sessions consist of high intensity interval training and typically involve bodyweight, sled, and lower weight kettlebell exercises. These sessions are amazing from both a cardio and strength perspective. While you go at your own pace, the group dynamic makes you more likely to push yourself. The semi-private sessions are more focused on the main compound lifts -- bench press, squat, & deadlift. Similar to offseason athletic training, the program is carefully planned and split into different phases to maximize strength gains. Exercises in the earlier weeks will be lower weight with higher reps, whereas later weeks will be higher weight with lower reps. While less challenging from a cardio perspective than Krank, these sessions are where your strength gains are most visible as you'll begin to lift heavier amounts. Once again, the group dynamic is beneficial as a spotter allows you to lift more weight than you may be comfortable doing alone. I would highly recommend either Krank or Semi-Private sessions as they lead to both better conditioning and strength gains. They are both full body workouts with attention given to each muscle group. I would personally recommend a combination of the two sessions as they serve as great complements to one another.\n\nLast and most importantly, Dan, Miguel, and the other trainers are amazing. They're highly knowledgeable and you can tell that a great amount of time and care went into designing the workouts. They also provide attention and motivation to everyone in each session. If your form is wrong, they're going to let you know and help fix it (which prevents injury). If you're slacking, they're going to push you to do better. It truly is a great place to workout and I can't recommend it highly enough.",

            "Start your review of Life Time One Wall Street",
            "Not a safe gym for female members.\nI recently had an unfortunate experience at Lifetime Wall street where I encountered harassment from a male member. Despite reporting the incident to the gym staff, the response I received was disappointing and insufficient.\nThis particular male, stood over the top of me while I was using 1 of several free squat machines in an attempt to scare me away. Not only did he refuse to leave me in peace he used profanities in an attempt to continue pressing his aggression. I reported the situation to the staff, hoping for a resolution and support given the matter was recorded. However, the actions taken by the gym fell short of addressing the issue adequately which should have at the very least included contacting me. Bad enough that a male felt brazen enough to act this way, even worse when other males fail to act, effectively protecting him and encouraging similar behavior in the future.\nThe gym management should to take harassment complaints seriously, thoroughly investigate such incidents, and implement stronger measures to create a secure environment for all members. Additionally, improving communication and support systems for members who face such situations is essential.\nPlease think twice before considering Life time Wall street if you prioritize a gym environment that actively addresses and prevents harassment for woman.",
            "I am rating this gym based on an open house. There is a pre-opening sale going on and an open house which I attended last evening. So please take this into consideration since this review is from this vantage point.\n\nThe entrance is right past the security checkpoint on new street. I had to pass there twice in order to notice there was an entrance I missed the construction.\n\nWhen I went in I had to show my photo ID and completed a form in an iPad device.\n\nAt the coffee bar section there were hors d'oeuvres and wine. I had the avocado hors d'oeuvre which was very good and romance wine. Who wouldn't want romance in their life?\n\nThere were others sitting around as well. I also noticed some stuff approaching random people there for the open house. After sitting at the bar for a good 10 minutes and checking my phone I noticed that there were staff randomly selecting people. I even did eye contact with one but was not approached. Then I saw one Staff approaching a nearby lady for The tour and I asked to join them. The sales agent, Isa was friendly and open to my questions. So if you sign up, do ask for her.\n\nThe gym is spread out across several floors. One floor is the entrance with the coffee/protein shake bar and then there's an elevator and stairs to go to the other floors.\n\nThere was a small and elegant spa as well as the weight room and the fitness rooms. I personally liked the whirlpool and sauna though they look rather small for a place of the size. Amenities are in the ladies room and men's room equivalent. It's not gender mixed.\n\nThere was a cool scale that I would like to try if I do join.\n\nWill I join? Well if my apartment building didn't have a gym I may have a joined. Having read other reviews for other locations and how people were sized up this reminds me of the experience I had while waiting for someone to select me for the tour , it makes me wonder if there is indeed a \"certain look\". For that, I prefer to skip on that stress for now. Who knows in the future?\n\nSo if you're looking for a classy gym that's spacious with new equipment then this is the gym for you. I was hoping this gym had a pool or sundeck which it doesn't.",
            "This has to be one of the best gyms I've ever been to. It's always very clean and not too crowded. I really enjoy the classes and the options of classes that they have. The instructors in almost all my classes have been very nice and motivating. They have a nice locker room as well even though I don't use it that much, I mostly go to the classes. I highly recommend this gym.",
            "Amazing place ! Very clean areas, very profesional stuff, I can spend hours here, maybe add a cold plunge but besides that is great.",
            "Nice gym but not worth the money.. they raised the prices recently too.. Day passes are now $100?! That's ridiculous and a turn off.\n\nI was paying $50 per day occasionally and was considering joining full time. Not anymore.. why pay these ridiculous prices when equinox is just as nice and significantly cheaper.",
            "had a massage with Karina Sosa. It was so good!!! And the gym is amazing, it has really nice facilities, and super friendly staff.",
            "Im almost a week in on my new Life Time membership and have split my time between this location and Dumbo, so my review is in reference to both. While I prefer the layout at Wall Street, the Dumbo location has a 25m pool, a full sized basketball court, and a HUGE outdoor deck/lounge area. Both have two dedicated yoga studios. One is for regular classes and the other is for heated. Yes, hot yoga classes that go for 30-40 bucks a pop at other places are included with your membership. I've taken two so far. Warrior Sculpt wasn't for me, but I enjoyed SOL and would take it again. One of my favorite fire instructors from Heat Wise yoga (Elise) teaches at both so BONUS! Both locations have a spin studio and both locations have separate studios for classes other than yoga. The Wall Street location has a dedicated Barre studio (not sure about Dumbo) and while I haven't taken a class yet, I did meet the instructor Dani who seemed super fun ...... so it's on my list. Both locations have a coffee bar lounge area as well as a separate cafe. There is plenty of space available in both for remote work if you want to bring your laptop. Both locations offer spa services, but the Wall Street location also has a hair salon and the equivalent of a mini Sephora stocked with great brands (K-18, Moroccan Oil, etc).\n\nThere are floors and floors of any type of equipment your little heart desires including multiple (as in more than 4) squat racks. The functional training area at Wall Street makes a little more sense to me as it's split between two areas at Dumbo.\n\nBoth locations have an amazing locker room including steam, sauna, and jacuzzi. The whirlpool at Wall Street is hotter, but the steam room at Dumbo is bigger.\n\nBoth have Normatech recovery included in membership.\n\nThe clincher for me was the Alpha Strength class I took with Bennet. It's a CrossFit style class including Olympic lifts and individual coaching. While I did suffer a bit, it was fun, challenging, the music was great, and the breath of fresh air my workouts needed.\n\nLast but not least is every single person that I've encountered working there and working out there has been super friendly. While it is a luxury gym, it has miraculously managed to skip having anything even close to an exclusive snobby attitude.\n\nIs it expensive? Yep, but let's add it up. In the last week, I've taken two hot yoga classes and an individually coached CrossFit class. I've had 4 spa days, 2 lap swim sessions in the pool, and a Normatech session. If you piece the cost of all of these experiences out individually, I've already far exceeded the cost of a monthly membership in a week.\n\nAlso, their protein shakes are really good.",
            "This gym is absolutely money season. Was going to join equinox but rude and unwelcoming staff led me here. Clean and spacious facilities. Friendly staff. SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST in the business. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",

Also, the staff is super friendly and welcoming - the complete opposite of what I experienced at equinox Wall Street for the years I worked out there. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the alpha class tends to take over all of the squat racks and there aren't any others available for use during the time the class is running, which can be for several hours at a time on some days. This isn't a reason to switch gyms by any means, it can just be frustrating when you have to wait and wait and wait for the class to end so you can finally use the rack.

            "Start your review of Life Time One Wall Street",
            "Not a safe gym for female members.\nI recently had an unfortunate experience at Lifetime Wall street where I encountered harassment from a male member. Despite reporting the incident to the gym staff, the response I received was disappointing and insufficient.\nThis particular male, stood over the top of me while I was using 1 of several free squat machines in an attempt to scare me away. Not only did he refuse to leave me in peace he used profanities in an attempt to continue pressing his aggression. I reported the situation to the staff, hoping for a resolution and support given the matter was recorded. However, the actions taken by the gym fell short of addressing the issue adequately which should have at the very least included contacting me. Bad enough that a male felt brazen enough to act this way, even worse when other males fail to act, effectively protecting him and encouraging similar behavior in the future.\nThe gym management should to take harassment complaints seriously, thoroughly investigate such incidents, and implement stronger measures to create a secure environment for all members. Additionally, improving communication and support systems for members who face such situations is essential.\nPlease think twice before considering Life time Wall street if you prioritize a gym environment that actively addresses and prevents harassment for woman.",
            "I am rating this gym based on an open house. There is a pre-opening sale going on and an open house which I attended last evening. So please take this into consideration since this review is from this vantage point.\n\nThe entrance is right past the security checkpoint on new street. I had to pass there twice in order to notice there was an entrance I missed the construction.\n\nWhen I went in I had to show my photo ID and completed a form in an iPad device.\n\nAt the coffee bar section there were hors d'oeuvres and wine. I had the avocado hors d'oeuvre which was very good and romance wine. Who wouldn't want romance in their life?\n\nThere were others sitting around as well. I also noticed some stuff approaching random people there for the open house. After sitting at the bar for a good 10 minutes and checking my phone I noticed that there were staff randomly selecting people. I even did eye contact with one but was not approached. Then I saw one Staff approaching a nearby lady for The tour and I asked to join them. The sales agent, Isa was friendly and open to my questions. So if you sign up, do ask for her.\n\nThe gym is spread out across several floors. One floor is the entrance with the coffee/protein shake bar and then there's an elevator and stairs to go to the other floors.\n\nThere was a small and elegant spa as well as the weight room and the fitness rooms. I personally liked the whirlpool and sauna though they look rather small for a place of the size. Amenities are in the ladies room and men's room equivalent. It's not gender mixed.\n\nThere was a cool scale that I would like to try if I do join.\n\nWill I join? Well if my apartment building didn't have a gym I may have a joined. Having read other reviews for other locations and how people were sized up this reminds me of the experience I had while waiting for someone to select me for the tour , it makes me wonder if there is indeed a \"certain look\". For that, I prefer to skip on that stress for now. Who knows in the future?\n\nSo if you're looking for a classy gym that's spacious with new equipment then this is the gym for you. I was hoping this gym had a pool or sundeck which it doesn't.",
            "This has to be one of the best gyms I've ever been to. It's always very clean and not too crowded. I really enjoy the classes and the options of classes that they have. The instructors in almost all my classes have been very nice and motivating. They have a nice locker room as well even though I don't use it that much, I mostly go to the classes. I highly recommend this gym.",
            "Amazing place ! Very clean areas, very profesional stuff, I can spend hours here, maybe add a cold plunge but besides that is great.",
            "Nice gym but not worth the money.. they raised the prices recently too.. Day passes are now $100?! That's ridiculous and a turn off.\n\nI was paying $50 per day occasionally and was considering joining full time. Not anymore.. why pay these ridiculous prices when equinox is just as nice and significantly cheaper.",

            "Im almost a week in on my new Life Time membership and have split my time between this location and Dumbo, so my review is in reference to both. While I prefer the layout at Wall Street, the Dumbo location has a 25m pool, a full sized basketball court, and a HUGE outdoor deck/lounge area. Both have two dedicated yoga studios. One is for regular classes and the other is for heated. Yes, hot yoga classes that go for 30-40 bucks a pop at other places are included with your membership. I've taken two so far. Warrior Sculpt wasn't for me, but I enjoyed SOL and would take it again. One of my favorite fire instructors from Heat Wise yoga (Elise) teaches at both so BONUS!

            "Was my main gym for most of 2023. The weight section is very well designed and navigable. The abundance of squat racks relative to other Equinox locations is noticeable. They do need more freestanding benches but otherwise I have little trouble accessing equipment or weights - even during busy hours. Trainers seem friendly and competent.\n\nLockerroom experience isn't good because this location is particularly overcrowded. It's not uncommon for them to run out of towels during peak periods, leading to 10-20 minute wait times for towels/showers.",
            "Altagracia is amazing!!! So happy to have meet her. She is a membership advisor at Prince Street, gave mw such a warm welcome, nice tour of the space. There is so much natural lighting in the gym, so many beautiful rooms to take classes. She is super kind, made a gym\nPlan that worked for me and i have been going almost everyday. Even when its crowded there is plenty of free space to work during peak hours. The staff is very friendly, welcoming and energetic!!!\n\nHit her up and go for it! Its 100\nPerfect worth it!",
            "Aicardo the Membership advisor is so much! I came in to work out, he showed me around the gym and pointed out the machines for my work out. Super nice guy! Great gym, good smoothies, and Kielh's products in the locker room :)",
            "I live in walking distance between Equinox SoHo, Bond St., and Orchard St. While the latter two are newer and have a more modern aesthetic and seem to be more clean in general, I still prefer the SoHo location because of the large open layout and machines. Several Equinox locations in NYC have equipment spread across multiple floors, which can have you running up and down stairs in confusion looking for what you need, which can be particularly annoying and time-consuming if you're trying to do a superset routine or just want to stay in the zone.\n\nI also think the staff is super friendly and helpful! I'm always chatting with the trainers and if I ever have any questions about equipment or a move - or simply want to get a second set of eyes on my deadlift form, they are more than happy to help. I've made friends with lots of regulars, too.\n\nI wish I could give this place 5 stars but on the downside, I find it's not as clean or beautiful as other locations. For what I pay, sometimes it lacks that luxury look and feel that other locations offer. The Yoga studio is always a bit stinky and the men's locker room could be nicer (love the one at Bond St which is also much cleaner).\n\nLastly for some reason they've removed hand sanitizing stations and most of the sanitary wipe stations, citing no need for them post-pandemic. I find that a bit odd because regardless of a pandemic, it's a gym, strangers are sweating and equipment gets gross. Why not make it easy for us to keep things clean?\n\nHowever since I'm mostly there to work, and I enjoy my workout time thoroughly because the layout and the friendly staff, these issues aren't a huge deal to me. It would just be nice if they could put some time into improving these areas.",
            "Honestly this gym is my favorite equinox location probably. Obviously it is expensive, but relative to other equinox Gyms in the city this one is a cool experience where it feels like you get what you pay for.\n\nMy main qualms come from when signing up i was told i could get 2 guest passes per billing cycle (i'm billed monthly so i thought i had two per month) but it's 2 per YEAR and i used them both the first week thinking it was two per month.\n\nThen i tried to get my coworker a day pass for a trial as he was interested maybe in joining and i called twice and no one got back to me.",
            "Loved visiting the Equinox in Soho! The staff were accommodating, and warm.\n\nThe gym has a beautiful, modern look, with a generous amount of equipment.\n\nThe locker room were clean and well kept.\n\nThey have great classes there, and good space to do your own stretches.\n\nAnd lastly, the Juice Generations here had a fun, attentive staff, that quickly made a delicious smoothie.\n\nWould definitely reccommend visiting this location!",
            "Like everyone else has mentioned recently, Equinox is getting your money unless you have a notarized letter with witnesses detailing you tried to cancel your membership within 10 minutes of establishing it so long as you didn't drink water or use a towel. EQX is a complete waste of time unless there are literally no other gyms you can access...and this is Soho, so take that as you will.",

I find that a bit odd because regardless of a pandemic, it's a gym, strangers are sweating and equipment gets gross. Why not make it easy for us to keep things clean?\n\nHowever since I'm mostly there to work, and I enjoy my workout time thoroughly because the layout and the friendly staff, these issues aren't a huge deal to me.

            "Continuing my quest to work out at every Equinox in Manhattan. I took Best Stretch Ever and it was good, different from Brookfield Place with Q, but still worth the time. Then I had some time until the next class, so I shopped at the store. A cute bag caught my eye. I'm a sucker for handbags, and the Think Royln Bar bag looked so inviting that I just had to try it on. Three detachable straps! I could use the straps for my other bags. I did have a $100 gift card for joining and 15% off. So I got the bag! The only thing is after I got home, I realized that this bag also comes with gold hardware and I have several black bags with gold hardware, so I am hoping to exchange it. I love the detachable straps for my Chanels with gold hardware. At my age, functionality is everything, and the Chanels often don't have functional straps.\n\nThen I took the Bala Bangle Barre Burn class with Or Artzi and what energy! Love the music, moves and positivity! I felt the burn and will probably be sore the next day. At the end, Or gave us a meditation of sorts and told us we can have any thing if we believe.

I've made friends with lots of regulars, too.\n\nI wish I could give this place 5 stars but on the downside, I find it's not as clean or beautiful as other locations. For what I pay, sometimes it lacks that luxury look and feel that other locations offer. The Yoga studio is always a bit stinky and the men's locker room could be nicer (love the one at Bond St which is also much cleaner).\n\nLastly for some reason they've removed hand sanitizing stations and most of the sanitary wipe stations, citing no need for them post-pandemic. I find that a bit odd because regardless of a pandemic, it's a gym, strangers are sweating and equipment gets gross. Why not make it easy for us to keep things clean?\n\nHowever since I'm mostly there to work, and I enjoy my workout time thoroughly because the layout and the friendly staff, these issues aren't a huge deal to me. It would just be nice if they could put some time into improving these areas.",
            "Honestly this gym is my favorite equinox location probably. Obviously it is expensive, but relative to other equinox Gyms in the city this one is a cool experience where it feels like you get what you pay for.\n\nMy main qualms come from when signing up i was told i could get 2 guest passes per billing cycle (i'm billed monthly so i thought i had two per month) but it's 2 per YEAR and i used them both the first week thinking it was two per month.\n\nThen i tried to get my coworker a day pass for a trial as he was interested maybe in joining and i called twice and no one got back to me.",

            "Continuing my quest to work out at every Equinox in Manhattan. I took Best Stretch Ever and it was good, different from Brookfield Place with Q, but still worth the time. Then I had some time until the next class, so I shopped at the store. A cute bag caught my eye. I'm a sucker for handbags, and the Think Royln Bar bag looked so inviting that I just had to try it on. Three detachable straps! I could use the straps for my other bags. I did have a $100 gift card for joining and 15% off. So I got the bag! The only thing is after I got home, I realized that this bag also comes with gold hardware and I have several black bags with gold hardware, so I am hoping to exchange it. I love the detachable straps for my Chanels with gold hardware. At my age, functionality is everything, and the Chanels often don't have functional straps.\n\nThen I took the Bala Bangle Barre Burn class with Or Artzi and what energy! Love the music, moves and positivity! I felt the burn and will probably be sore the next day. At the end, Or gave us a meditation of sorts and told us we can have any thing if we believe. And I believe, Or, I believe!",
            "Was my main gym for most of 2023. The weight section is very well designed and navigable. The abundance of squat racks relative to other Equinox locations is noticeable. They do need more freestanding benches but otherwise I have little trouble accessing equipment or weights - even during busy hours. Trainers seem friendly and competent.\n\nLockerroom experience isn't good because this location is particularly overcrowded. It's not uncommon for them to run out of towels during peak periods, leading to 10-20 minute wait times for towels/showers.",
            "Altagracia is amazing!!! So happy to have meet her. She is a membership advisor at Prince Street, gave mw such a warm welcome, nice tour of the space. There is so much natural lighting in the gym, so many beautiful rooms to take classes. She is super kind, made a gym\nPlan that worked for me and i have been going almost everyday. Even when its crowded there is plenty of free space to work during peak hours. The staff is very friendly, welcoming and energetic!!!\n\nHit her up and go for it! Its 100\nPerfect worth it!",
            "Aicardo the Membership advisor is so much! I came in to work out, he showed me around the gym and pointed out the machines for my work out. Super nice guy! Great gym, good smoothies, and Kielh's products in the locker room :)",
            "I live in walking distance between Equinox SoHo, Bond St., and Orchard St. While the latter two are newer and have a more modern aesthetic and seem to be more clean in general, I still prefer the SoHo location because of the large open layout and machines.

            "Went to my first class via Classpass last week. What drew me to the class was that the description states that the ab exercises wouldn't just be the usual traditional ones and also it was just 45 min long. Upon going, I looked up SSL and used the address listed (Mulberry St). I went in and put my stuff down and it took at least a few min for someone to come up to me and ask what I was here for. I said it was for the class and it turns out it's in a DIFFERENT location. So first timers...beware. Make sure you check the address and go to the one listed in the classpass e-mail. I was not aware there were two different locations so I didn't think I would have had to check both sources for the address. As for the Spring St location, I like that the layout is very sleek and minimal. But the turf (?) is extremely uncomfortable especially after more than several minutes of exercises where your arms and hands have to be in contact with the floor (they have mats avail if needed). The class itself went by very fast...the instructor was very friendly and came by to correct form or help out anyone who needed modifications. But the structure was a bit more lax as another reviewer mentioned so I wish that there was some sort of clearer timer to countdown each exercise. After class finished, I asked where I can put the used towels away and the girl at the front desk was super confused and said we could just leave them on the desk. Which was a bit odd because you would think that they would know since they work there?",
            "I did 3 personal training sessions with ***. Training was solid. Trainer was great. The gym is really barely ok. I get what they are going for but it does get pretty hot and cramped in there. If you live close enough to come and go in your gym clothes it will be much better than changing there. I would have continued but the cost, for me, is prohibitive.",
            "While on vacation I needed a place to keep my workouts going. HIIT classes, PT's and all the weights one needs right at you fingertips. Professional and knowledgeable staff willing to answer your questions and get you ripped. Just what I was looking for. Thanks guys I'll be back!",

The first class I picked from this platform was Angela's Athletic HIIT. What an awesome class! Angela's routines were very well thought out and planned and everyone got a great workout. There is good camaraderie and group energy which added to the greatness of the class. Definitely will return.\n\nUpdate 10/22/2019: As of yesterday 10/21 SoHo Strength Lab has left ClassPass.

            "And so my fitness studio crawl continues!\n\nI signed up for the \"Speed Lab\" through ClassPass and was pleased with how HARD yet satisfying the workout was. I'll be honest, it was really intimidating to walk in and see people who looked incredibly fit, with bulging biceps and pecs of steel (maybe I'm exaggerating). I was also surprised by how male-heavy the class was.\n\nThe studio was smaller than I imagined and didn't seem to have a designated changing area, so keep that in mind. Also the front desk wasn't too helpful when I signed in. I'm used to getting a tour whenever I'm new somewhere or at least a brief rundown of the place, but the woman seemed like she didn't know much about the studio. I asked if there were lockers and she said, \"I believe so.\" Huh? There ARE lockers both upstairs and downstairs, an astroturf section, kettlebells, weighted balls, and the SLED. Oh, the sled.\n\nThe fear wore off quickly as we got started with a light warmup and then went straight into the different circuits. Since it's a cardio-focused class, there were a lot of sprinting exercises, lateral shuffles, hopping, and pushing that damn sled (a heavy contraption that works your whole body!). It moves very quickly, with little rest time in between each circuit, and Andy demonstrated each move and offered modifications - thank goodness, cause I'm ALL about modifications.\n\nI work out fairly often (4-5x a week) but the 55 minutes at Soho Strength Lab truly challenged me. My heart was racing, I sweat like crazy and gasped for breath at times. Andy had us race against someone toward the end, and as a former high school sprinter, that really ignited the competitive spirit in me. I feel like Speed Lab is geared toward people who work out consistently, because I could imagine barfing if it was my first time doing cardio in a long time.\n\nIt's not my all-time favorite workout and I wish there were more amenities, but it's a good one!",

            "INCREDIBLE WORKOUT!!!\n\nWent there this weekend on a Saturday for the sweat class. This was my first time going to a group workout. I run about 20 miles a week, so I am by no means in amazing shape. The class was about 10 people, it was very challenging but not impossible. Andy the instructor was amazing at giving you pointers for making the circuits harder or easier depending on your level of fitness. I will definitely be going back, it is an awesome way to break up the monotony of a workout routine, i.e. running. Also if your a fitness maniac, there were some people training there who were in ridiculous shape.",

            "Hey Michael, thank you for your review. We\u2019re sorry to hear you had such a frustrating experience, but we appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention. Please reach out to us at CrunchMS@crunch.com so we can further address the situation. Thanks!",
            "I'm a pretty big fan of this crunch location. As a current Gympass member, I've had the privilege to try all kinds of gyms around the city like equinox, lifetime, NYSC, and others. I really feel like you get your bang for your buck here.\n\nThe location is the best part about this crunch. It's right near union square so it's easy to get to from pretty much anywhere. It's way more spacious inside than I expected. They have 4 squat racks and a lot of machines and tools that lifetime and equinox unfortunately lack (specifically the single leg hamstring curl machine and the foot rest for Bulgarian split squats). I wish they had more than two benches- there's often a small wait to use them but it's not too bad. I personally love going between 9-11pm because there's almost no one there. During lunch time between 1-3 is also a great time to go if you're able to.\n\nThe locker rooms and bathrooms could use a little more cleaning but overall I'm a big fan.",
            "Crunch regular here! I've been going to this gym for almost a year and half now and it's great. The best times are to go early morning, lunch time, or late at night (same as any other gym). They have fun equipment like ropes, ski ergs, sleds, and assault bikes. They have two studios that are free to use when no classes are going on, AND the bathrooms have saunas. It's not huge but it's not tiny either. Honestly just a really good, reliable gym.",
            "Christian and the rest of the staff at the front desk were so condescending and rude, refusing to let me check in MINUTES after my reservation. Not willing to work with me or give me any reason to sign up for a membership in the future when you run your business like that. Unreasonable and pathetic customer service, especially as a prospective member. No foresight",
            "As a regular at Crunch Fitness in Union Square, I can confidently say that this location is one of the best in Manhattan. The staff is always friendly and accommodating, and the male trainers are not only knowledgeable but also have impressive physiques, making the gym a pleasant and inviting place to work out. These male trainers are also very attractive, which only adds to the gym's overall appeal.\n\nFrom the moment I walk in, I feel welcomed by the warm and energetic atmosphere, and it's clear that the gym takes great care in creating an environment that motivates its members to push themselves. One thing that really sets this location apart from others is the availability of sanitizer wipes. I have never seen them run out, unlike other gyms I've been to where the dispensers are often empty.\n\nHowever, the gym urgently needs to put up a sign in the sauna to discourage members from pouring water into the electric sauna heater, as this poses a dangerous health hazard. Furthermore, in the men's locker room, lotion should be available by the mirrors by the lockers, as this would make it much more convenient for members to access. Currently, you have to walk all the way over to the sinks, which can be an inconvenience if you're half-naked.\n\nAlthough these may seem like minor details, I believe that going above and beyond in the little things can make a significant difference in a gym's overall experience. With these specific adjustments, I am confident that Crunch Fitness in Union Square would earn five stars. Overall, I highly recommend this gym to anyone looking for an inviting, energetic, and clean gym experience with male trainers who not only possess expert knowledge, impressive physiques but also happen to be very attractive.\n\nNote to Crunch's Yelp manager: Please share this review with the GM. Would prefer not to email CrunchMS@crunch.com as that is an unnecessary extra step that I've seen you ask other Yelp reviewers to do. This review should be considered submittable feedback.",
            "I don't write reviews often but would like to warn you all of this place. Beware of aggressive trainers who will make you feel uncomfortable. They are bored and will stand around and prey upon you. They will try to sell you something or just want to make conversation. One trainer in particular would follow me around every day and tap me on the shoulder or hit me with a towel to get my attention. I spoke with management twice and finally decided to cancel my membership because I couldn't stand walking in every day feeling like I needed to hide. Being harassed daily on the street in New York is enough and the gym should be a safe space. I decided to join a new gym that is a little over my budget and further away from my apartment just to get away. At this new gym I realize how trainers are not supposed to be hunting you 24/7.",
            "I like to review franchises with multiple locations to tell you all which location is good or not so great, especially when you have multiple locations to consider in one area (like NYC).\n\nThis one's good!\n\nStandard fitness machines/weights, gets busier at peak times obviously.\nGreat selection of group fitness classes and why I'm writing about it.\n\nIf you're into group classes (like me) then come here and try them out. I tried maaaaaany of them and can say enjoyed the vast majority pending I wanted a light Yoga class or a more intensive HIIT class, spin class.\nTheir yoga studio is also why this is one of my faves, even tho I don't consider myself a Yogi, hehehe, so this is based off your humble critics reviews.",

They will 1000% push you harder than you have ever been pushed. But also, they will joke with you, they will focus on you, they will make you feel like you can break through a wall. In addition, they will be able to do any and all exercises that they ask you to do and they could prob each do it 100 times, perfectly. That, in and of itself, will make you want to do it and do it right.\n\nThey are some of the nicest, most driven, down to earth people...expert trainers...motivators...friends, in the business.

Maybe it's because I'm not famous or a model?\n\nFor $200 a session, I would expect my trainer to at least look like he wants to be there! Never went back.\n\nI put 2 stars because he seemed like he knew what he was doing training wise (he just acted like he didn't want to do it)",
            "The best. They make you feel like part of the Smash City family. The staff and whole atmosphere is super warm, friendly, inspiring, encouraging and inclusive. I usually train with Christian - who is absolutely excellent, so upbeat and motivating - but have also had sessions with Sechew and Spencer, who were both brilliant too. I am overweight and frankly rubbish at exercising even though I quite enjoy it but the Dogpound team really gets me into it and makes you want to try and do your best plus there is absolutely no judgement or body shaming. It's the friendliest most inspiring gym ever. Can not recommend it highly enough",
            "Great trainers. Super motivating. I dislike working out. But love working out here!!!!. The best.",
            "Well it's just a crossfit gym. Nothing more and nothing less. They charge the average amount of money for a trainer. But let's be real, they have marketing down... they get ppl to selfie their company and that makes other ppl want to go. It does not mean this gym is better than any other gym.. it just means they get alot of ppl who dont work out or never have worked out in their life come here and think they are getting a better workout. Do not be fooled by thinking this gym is better than any other gym.. they are just good at marketing",
            "Let me begin by saying that I have had many experiences with all types of trainers. From California to New York every single trainer has let me down or not ended up being anything too special. As a flight attendant I have an extremely irregular schedule and I was looking for a trainer who would be committed and flexible and really be on board with me to get my body to the next level. Fast forward to a couple of months ago and while looking on Yelp I stumbled upon DOGPOUND. My first thought was \"this sounds like tough, militant, no nonsense training and maybe I should give them a shot, after all they have all five star glowing reviews online\". So I did.\n\nMy search for the perfect trainer has ended. I chose to workout with Kirk Myers (one of the owners) and he has turned out to be the most knowledgable,committed,enthusiastic,kind and enjoyable guy to spend an hour with each day. I used to dread workouts and now I feel excited for each workout knowing that Kirk is going to guide me in the right direction and push me to the next level with his unique approach to fitness. I have a ways to go but so far I am very happy with the great results I am seeing with my body.\n\nLet me also mention that if you think this is going to be your typical experience in another snobby high end gym with lots of attitude, think again. The DOGPOUND team literally rally's around their clients and introduces everyone to each other as they work out to create a feeling of community amongst their clients and trainers. It's awesome. The DOGPOUND environment has a feel of Zero judgement and 100% support while everyone has a great time doing their thing. These guys aren't cheep but let me tell you they are worth every fucking penny and more. I encourage anyone to try these guys out, you will not be disappointed, I guarantee it!",
            "ALL AROUND AMAZING!!!!! Lets talk about of Band of Brothers (and a sister I saw :) that love fitness and getting people the results they want to see!!\n\nI have to say, after going to another PT studio and not only being bored with the same-old routine, but the trainers were actually mean to each other (i guess competing over clients??) DOGPOUND was like joining a second family, LITERALLY!!! And not to mention they train in the ultra-swank David Barton Gym (but they are getting there own space soon...exciting!!)\n\nNOW to the real stuff, the workout. LORD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR BODY, by the third exercise, your legs will be shaking, asking for water breaks, sweat dripping all over your mat. And I'm no beginner (albeit slightly out of shape) but these are no easy tasks. But the best part, the motivation behind it! They're not talking your ear off, distracting you from the workout, nor barking at you like you are subhuman, but the best combo of both. Taking my mind off the task while making sure I'm doing it right, all 15 reps!!!\n\nHonest best part to me, you never work with the same trainer back to back, and believe me, its beneficial. Its a new workout every week , a new set of motivation, a new set of eyes on your body and your skills letting you know what you're doing right and what you can improve on.\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!! COME AND SMASH IT !!!!!",
            "Amazing boxing classes. Leaves you feeling very accomplished.\n\nWould recommend for sure!",
            "3 reasons I train at the Dogpound every time I visit New York:\n1. The vibe here is unique! It's a family and it's a baddass one\n2. Trainers are extremely knowledgeable. I learn something new every time I go and that's priceless if you are really interested in improving your performance.\n3. Equipment selection is just perfect! Wouldn't change a single thing.\n\nIf you are serious about your fitness game, this is where you should be working out! Try it out and thank me later."

            "I love working out here with Charlie! I have been working out on my own for years and I felt stagnant in my routine. Adding personal training sessions with Charlie has really enhanced my body and mind. He couples exercises together really well for maximum effectiveness and to meet your own goals. He also focus is on stretching before and after each session. Charlie will help warm you up so that you can push your body safely. He also helps cool you down after the workout to release tension in your muscles. The cool down consists of various assisted stretches and targeting areas with the theragun. Highly recommend.\n\nNimble is a nice gym. Everyone is doing some sort of one on one work out class and sharing the space comfortably. I have been there at many hours of the day and it is never too crowded. The facilities are well kept. A lot of great equipment of all kinds. There are showers so you can go before work. They have shower products and provide towels. The other trainers and staff are very friendly.",
            "I trained at Nimble for awhile before Covid; I don't know whether or not it's still owned by the same partners. But when I bought a package of sessions, one of the owners conducted an evaluation of my fitness level and concerns--it was wayyyy more talk on his part than working out on mine and I felt it was largely a waste of time. But then I was assigned a highly qualified trainer with whom I focused mostly on TRX, which I love. At some point, a friend told me he used to go to Nimble but left when he discovered that the owners at the time had very little depth of knowledge and pretty flimsy fitness credentials. I did some poking around and became convinced that this was true. That, and something I can only describe as my discomfort with the place's vibe, led me to leave as well. For what it's worth.",

I would highly recommend working with Jason / Nimble to anyone looking for a more focused and comprehensive fitness experience, and especially during pregnancy.",
            "Daniel, Keith, Jay and staff are elite trainers. They continually push their levels of knowledge through workshops and continuing education. My trainer Daniel shifted the way I deal with my body through foam roller techniques and learning about fascia tissue. He did this through zoom sessions. I have trained in their 12th street studio over the years when in NYC. Great spot, vibes, and excellent assessment for training and recovery needs. Highly recommend Nimble Fitness!",

            "This is my 6th month membership review of OTF Brooklyn heights:\n\n*The coaches and staff are amazing. (5/5). Coach Frankie and Bryan are my favorite because they're supportive. Different coaches have different teaching styles and level of involvement, so test out who works for you. The front staff are extremely helpful and friendly as well.\n\n1)The class schedule removes stars - even lower tier locations offer more class slots. For example, offering 5 classes on weekends whereas park slope (same tier level) offers 7 classes per day on weekends, plus more weight training classes. The last class here is at 1145AM on weekends.\n\n2) There are no private locker room areas at this location, so the changing area is crowded and frequently smells.\n\n3)Management is unreliable about membership pauses + billing changes. Having a chronic illness that requires me to take health breaks, I wasn't provided a follow up for my most recent pause inquiry. At ~$280/month for the membership, you'd think they'd follow up.\n\nThis location is personally not worth it for me. I recommend joining a Manhattan location if possible and visiting Brooklyn heights, as not to pay the surcharge.",
            "I came here for a free class and in general, really disliked this gym. Don't get me wrong, the ladies who worked at the front were really welcoming and nice. However, they needed my weight (which I don't want to know) because they set each person up with a heart rate monitor to measure progress throughout the work out. On top of that, they show everyone's stats on a screen in public view, which I was completely against. For some reason, they inputed my full name (first and last), while everyone else just had their first name present. Not cool at all.\n\nThe instructor for the class (if you can call it that) was okay. She came around and helped me a few times throughout. The first half hour was solely on the treadmill, which I hated. I wasn't going that fast and it made me feel like I wasn't at the same level as everyone else. Also, I'm just not a fan of being on treadmills... I don't find it fun.\n\nAfter the treadmill portion, there were floor exercises that were displayed on a screen. I liked this part much more. I needed assistance a few times and the instructor noticed that, so came around to show me how it was done.\n\nOverall, it didn't really feel like a class because the instructor didn't actually show us the moves for us to follow. We were left to do the work out mostly on our own. I left without getting more information because I already knew this place just wasn't for me.",
            "My sister introduced me to Orange Theory over a year ago and while I thought the trial class was fun, I wasn't ready to invest the money at the time. A year later, I was out of shape and needed to get fit for my wedding so I decided to give Orange Theory a try again. Best decision I've ever made.\n\nI've been a member for about 6 months and have noticed a vast difference in my fitness and health. The workouts are always challenging (a combination of Treadmill, Rowing, and Floor Exercises) and I really love the variety as they are always introducing new exercises (no class is ever the same). I love that while you are in a group class, you get the individual attention like a personal trainer throughout every class. The coaches are all so positive, energetic, and encouraging (a huge shoutout to Garner, Taylor, and Naomi). I really appreciate all the time they've spent teaching me correct form and motivating me when I'm struggling.\n\nThe studio itself is very clean and as a Premier location they provide towels and lockers. They offer classes throughout the day (early AM through late evening) and I've never had an issue finding a time that was convenient with my schedule. The desk staff are also very friendly as well.\n\nThank you to this studio for making exercise fun again!",
            "The front desk staff were really friendly and welcoming for my first class, so A+ for them. They did explain to us (I went with a group) how the different heart rate zones work, but I wish they could have talked a bit more about the class format itself. While group training is something I am most definitely into, I was not a big fan of OT.\n\nI didn't feel that the instructors were eyeballing form enough -- which is always tricky because it leads to injuries, esp. for newcomers. And I didn't love the TV monitor instructions...but I can't explain why. Also, I hate hate hate treadmills. I'd rather pound the pavement outdoors any day.\n\nUltimately I think this all boils down to personal preference. For me, I prefer a smaller setting, more attentive instructors and different types of workout equipment.",
            "I came in for a trial class since I have heard so much about OTF.

Best decision I've ever made.\n\nI've been a member for about 6 months and have noticed a vast difference in my fitness and health.

Bob is so enthusiastic, welcoming, and genuinely cares about every individual that comes into the studio. The group classes are a perfect size, and they feel so much more intimate and personalized than any group class I've taken elsewhere.

Some instructors are more challenging than others (even tho all classes are considered \"open level\") but I like to mix it up a bit.",

I actually had to google what the difference was between gyrotonic and pliates since our instructor didn't really explain what gyrotonics is...or even introduce who she was.\n\nGyrotonics provides training in full mobility of your joints and spine using fluid circular movements, while Pilates focuses more on the muscles.\n\nOur gyrotonic class was small (4 people). My sister and I both agreed that our instructor had a snooty vibe, and didn't do the best job with explaining or helping the students out with the fundamentals. There were points in the class where she would giggle or make some sort of snarky comment towards us. It didn't help that she she spoke softly, which also contributed to the class having a hard time understanding what she wanted us to do.\n\nThe studio itself is clean yet small. There are lockers at the entrance of the place.\n\nI might have to give this place another chance the next time I'm visiting the city, but with a different instructor. I don't think I can rate this place lower than 3 stars since this is my first experience with pilates/gyrotonics. This is how I came up with my rating:\n\nInstructor: 2 stars\nStudio: 4 stars",

My sister and I both agreed that our instructor had a snooty vibe, and didn't do the best job with explaining or helping the students out with the fundamentals. There were points in the class where she would giggle or make some sort of snarky comment towards us. It didn't help that she she spoke softly, which also contributed to the class having a hard time understanding what she wanted us to do.\n\nThe studio itself is clean yet small. There are lockers at the entrance of the place.\n\nI might have to give this place another chance the next time I'm visiting the city, but with a different instructor. I don't think I can rate this place lower than 3 stars since this is my first experience with pilates/gyrotonics. This is how I came up with my rating:\n\nInstructor: 2 stars\nStudio: 4 stars",

Nicole, our instructor for that day's class, probably recognizes her regulars from new students though and was so kind to have everyone move over for us newbies to sit together. There were 7 students/machines in total for our class, alongside a Gyrotonic class happening on the inner side.\n\nAs soon as we hopped on, we got right into it! Hot girl summer? More like hard working strong girl summer, as I sure felt every stretch and sweat with each exercise! Nicole would calmly give new set instructions, and offer visual demonstrations with her body that I found helpful. That, and looking at the regular next to me!\n\nFor someone new to pilates reformers, I found the class difficult, yet relaxing. It's like doing a calmer Chloe Ting workout on a cool machine.

It was an enjoyable evening.\n\nWhat was remarkably with the company is I was running late (damn you MTA!) and my friends spoke with organizer who actually gave a ten minute grace! I made it within that window and I was able to enjoy the play. I thanked the lady after but I'm so sorry I didn't get her name to publicly thank her here.\n\nTaking pics of course is frowned upon but when has that ever stopped me.\n\nBuilding was clean and looked well kept. 14th street Y's staff was very friendly and welcoming.\n\nI'll definitely consider attending other events here.\n\nThe End.",
            "I took the 10-session adult beginner swim class here for $296. The class is split into 3 groups based on level. I was surprised to discover I was the only one in the first group, having zero swim experience. The best part is that this means I pretty much experienced personal lessons. My instructor, Mayline, was amazing! She was very nice and patient, but also pushed me outside my comfort zone. I was nervous to swim the entire length of the pool (~20 yds) but she was confident I could do it, and I did! Swim class was a success\n\nThe facilities overall are decent, not sparkling but I've also seen worse. There is a good amount of lockers so you can always find an available one. There is a small sauna - I've never seen anyone in it so I guess the tight space is not an issue! They don't offer towels or other toiletries so make sure to pack your own. Note I never used the gym equipment so can't comment there.\n\nI absolutely recommend Mayline and the other swim instructors. Some of the other employees here are questionable. The security guard is just a dude in a t-shirt that looks for a flash of a membership card when you walk in - don't think he'd be much help in an actual emergency. There is also a kid that takes attendance for the swim class and then sits there. Not sure of his role as he doesn't seem like a lifeguard. Anyway, the biggest issue I have with this place is there is an absolute NO make-up class policy. If you miss class for any reason, that's a sunk cost to you and you're short one class. I really don't understand why they can't let you into a class later in the week or the following week as classes continue all year round.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the swim class so I have to give it 4 stars!",
            "Poor attitude from front desk.\n\nI like to play basketball so the 14th st Y would be a great spot for some indoor games. I had used a guest pass once and it seemed like a nice facility.\nI decided to later come back with my two younger brothers to have them try it.\n\nHowever this time when I mentioned the free guest pass I was told in a condescending tone that, \"guest passes are only for people interested in membership\". I did not see that language anywhere online or in their policy. And I was not given this hassle the previous visit. Only difference I can imagine was the way I was dressed and that I came w my siblings ? (Shirt and pants vs basketball gear)\n\nI explained I don't think that's a rule, and that how does she assess (assume) who wants a membership or not? She just rolled her eyes and said if I really wanted the pass I'd have to wait and talk to someone and tour through the whole facility- which I did not do the prior visit.\n\nSo I said screw it I'll pay, the sign up front said $20 a pass, and when I went to pay she said \"its $25 now actually\".\n\nJust really strange behavior/attitude from a community organization. If the free pass is not indeed free, that should be stated. Also management should be careful to allow employees to make judgements on who gets/doesn't get to trial the facility.",
            "This is such an amazing resource for families! They have daycare for $5 an hour while I work out! How amazing is that! Once your little one is 6mo old, they'll watch him but you can take a bunch of different \"mommy and me\" classes once you feel ready to work out. I started coming when my son was about 4 months old, and felt comfortable being out with him for a workout. My favorite class is with Kim on Thursdays, it's \"New Body, New You\" and it's fun b/c she's so great with the babies! If you little one cries, she knows how to distract them (she's dynamic and so animated!) so that you can keep your workout on!\n\nAll of the daycare staff are wonderful, Jennifer and Vanessa are there mostly during the week, so I see them the most.\n\nThe gym is also in good shape and it's never crowded. The locker rooms and sauna are nice and refinished. I like the crowd that come here too, mostly seniors and new moms like me. I'm a talker, so I always end up chatting with someone in the sauna.\n\nThank you 14th street Y for being such an amazing resource.",
            "Sometimes you just need a no frills gym to get your workout on. I bought a Living Social deal for this gym, 6 day passes for $25. What a great deal, for less than $5 per visit, you can use their gym and also take classes here.\n\nI came here this past week and was able to use the gym without hassle. The front desk clerk checked me in without any drama and within 15 minutes, I was on a treadmill jogging my way to my 4 mile goal.\n\nI like his gym because it isn't crowded. Now granted there isn't anything pretty about this place (ie fluorescent lighting and bland furniture), but it gets the job done. The locker room is nice (probably renovated recently) with ample space to change, plenty of lockers (bring your own lock or buy one for $10 at the desk), a sauna, showers, bathrooms, hair dryers and nicely lit mirrors.\n\nAfter my 4 mile jog on the treadmill, I took a Vinyasa yoga class in one of the upstairs community rooms. Our instructor was very nice and easy to follow. She adjusted the class for all the different level yogis in the class. Free mats available, with yoga blocks and straps for you to use.\n\nI will definitely be back to finish my passes, but also because I enjoyed the calm and drama-free gym. If you are serious about your workout and don't mind a gym without ambiance, this place will do. It worked for me!",

            "I took the 10-session adult beginner swim class here for $296. The class is split into 3 groups based on level.

My instructor, Mayline, was amazing! She was very nice and patient, but also pushed me outside my comfort zone.

Note I never used the gym equipment so can't comment there.\n\nI absolutely recommend Mayline and the other swim instructors. Some of the other employees here are questionable. The security guard is just a dude in a t-shirt that looks for a flash of a membership card when you walk in - don't think he'd be much help in an actual emergency. There is also a kid that takes attendance for the swim class and then sits there. Not sure of his role as he doesn't seem like a lifeguard. Anyway, the biggest issue I have with this place is there is an absolute NO make-up class policy. If you miss class for any reason, that's a sunk cost to you and you're short one class. I really don't understand why they can't let you into a class later in the week or the following week as classes continue all year round.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the swim class so I have to give it 4 stars!",

            "This gym is poorly run. Equipment is incorrectly installed so one cannot get bench in to lift but management does not care. There is no movement, yoga, meditation room like other gyms. One of the gym class rooms ( yoga room) , gets used for childcare a large part of the day so gym members have no access. The pool\n\nAlot of the classes conflict with one another so you can only do one class - not that there are so many classes each day.\nSign up is confusing as the schedule page lists classes for multiple facilities. There are no tvs which even planet fitness at $9 a month has! Staff is generally nice.\nThe aerobics classes have only 5 lb weights at most, consisting of sand bags which leak. Few aerobics classes except 2 ( with IVY ,which are great) but management declines to add more because supposedly they seek to \"trend younger\". Yes ageism is alive and well at this Y! They forgot that it was the older folks who kept their membership throughout the pandemic and kept it from going bankrupt. Sad because it could be better run.",

            "Half of the treadmills are either completely out of order, or the hydraulics don't work at all. They get up to the desired incline and then collapse like tired mules. For months these machines have been out of order. Fix them!\n\nThis summer I've gotten a kick out of the 13yo kids at the weight rack lifting. This blows my mind. The best part... they are here for free! Jamming the gym and taking over all the good equipment.\n\nAlso, there is no place to do any core work. People all congregate to a section of ellipticals in southwest corner of the gym that no one ever uses. Here's an idea... get rid of the 12 ellipticals and those other two pedal machines that I've never seen used even once in the 15 months I've been a member.\n\nPhoto is everyone doing core work in the aisle because there is no space anywhere.\n\nOne more thing... why always turn the rowers to look at everyone in the gym? Every single piece of cardio equipment faces the same wall, but you guys insist on turning the only two towers to look at everyone like I'm a Row House instructor. Why?",
            "Every location I've been to has the kindest staff which I really appreciate.\n\nNot the trendiest gym, but I think trendy gyms are overrated. Even luxury gyms tend to have mechanical issues, mild smell issues and wait times for equipment.\n\nHOWEVER, Staff has recently been instructed to start taking PHOTOS OF CLEANING DONE IN THE LOCKER ROOM. This is unethical and a potential danger to patrons who are in a vulnerable position in the locker rooms, predators might share vulnerable photos or otherwise make customers uncomfortable with this policy! It is ridiculous that PF would compromise privacy over this. I've been a member for 5-6 years and have considered leaving over this policy, it's not ok to have staff taking photographs in the locker room, while people are in there, as part of company policy. This is wrong and it needs to stop.",
            "Every time I arrive at this fitness club the staff here are always friendly, pleasant and professional. And they really keep the gym up to par with cleanliness. This week when I arrived I have noticed that the bathroom was clean this time. I would like to encourage management to ensure that the bathrooms are kept clean at all times. Including the locker rooms. Thank you.",
            "It's fantastic to hear that you consistently experience friendly and professional service from the staff at our Planet!\nIf you want to invite a friend to join in on the fun, you can share this link for a Free Day Pass: Additionally, if you haven't already, give our app a try to make check-ins even more convenient:",
            "The negative reviews here are kindof unbelievable. For 10 bucks a month, this gym vastly exceeds my expectations. It's less crowded than the NYSC by me, always has treadmills available, and has a decent array of weight machines. It would be nice if they had some more smith machines and more benches for free weights, but overall it's a pretty similar experience to a suburban PFs I've been to before and provides everything I need for my workouts. The bathrooms and locker rooms are not the nicest, but I don't shower at the gym, and the lockers are functional enough and plentiful. 5 stars without hesitation, best value in New York by a mile.",
            "Good value for the money, good price, polite staff, and nice machines! My club is clean and pleasant. I like the massage equipment and the fact that I can use other PF clubs when I travel.",
            "Planet fitness So liar!. They say easy in easy out. Yet they do not let you cancel membership the way I joined the gym. Fact I didn't use it much. With Pandemic and Monkey pots it wasn't smart thing, saddly I paid for the membership repeatedly.. I recently found time to go. However the equipment was damaged from wrong use from some $1 a month sale of \"new to workouts grouping\" $1 a month is target teenagers and new to work out folks who don't know the equipment and the cheapo offer doesn't include trainer basics. So. Me paying full price gets jipped. I tried a few perks fine but fact I needed to cancel. I REPEATEDLY TRIED THEY DISS ME. claims I can't cancel the way I joined. Mean of them. They no care that they over profited anyway I just need cancel now nope they are liars and canceling is full of hassle. For all I know they have a problem with my darker me. Many seemly bothered with me actually using the stupid perks even going in. Fact I tan in the sun it's summer why hate?\n\nPlanet fitness is a lair its not easy in easy out nothing. And no it's not that I no know how to workout. They are liars.",
            "ITS NOT 24 HOURS!!! It may say that on Apple Maps but it's not true but it is a good gym but it stays super crowded.",
            "I have been coming to this location of planet fitness for about a year now, and held my tongue on many many issues. Knowing that this is the cheapest gym option in the city, I felt I couldn't complain. But now I feel included to leave a complaint to warn others who may be wanting to join this gym. Over the past few months, many of their machines have been broken. I have inquired with the front desk staff a few times, and they advised a \"request has been submitted\". Ok, totally understand that HOWEVER - after two months of the cable machine being down and 3 out of 4 stairmasters broken without any fixes, and countless weight machines broken, I followed up again. The woman working at the counter rudely said \"well, there are other gyms\" in response to my very valid complaint that the repairs were taking too long.\n\nSo per this woman's advice, I will be finding another gym that has working equipment! Thank you to her, for her blunt honesty in admitting this gym is not worth anyones money.\n\nLastly, this is such a shame because I have been to other planet fitness locations in other states that are immaculate and have fully functioning equipment. They have a great opportunity to provide an affordable option for exercise for NYC residents, and they really fell short.\n\nSave your time, spend money at another gym, not worth it.",
            "I left a super harsh review here earlier and then did some self reflection and have changed my tune. I had a negative experience earlier today but it was probably an aberration and really not that big a deal.\n\nI was impressed management responded to the review pretty quickly and professionally.\n\nPlanet fitness is what it is. It's much less expensive than most nyc gyms so it isn't fair to expect the same kind of resources. Considering how inexpensive it is it's rock solid and it's unfair for anyone to complain. I think it's a good option for anyone not looking to spend a zillion $ on a gym membership.",
            "The TVs on the treadmills and elliptical machines rarely work. It seems like an easy fix. So please fix!"

I used to train at Equinox and hated it because it was always so crowded and the trainers there just don't have the level of experience and expertise like they do at Cordell.\n\nThey are so professional and my body has shown great results because the trainers really know how to push you without making you want to kill your self/dread working out. I've become stronger and my body has gained significantly more lean definition that I was looking to build. I've even seen other clients transform their bodies while working out here!\n\nIf you're looking for personal training, look no further, come here!",
            "4 things that I think make Cordell Fitness the best and most effective personal training gym that money can buy in NYC:\n\nEXPERTISE. Shawna Cordell, Rahim, Emma and the rest of the team bring decades of experience and intelligence around anatomy, fitness, nutrition and biomechanics to their clients. You truly get expert guidance for your money. These are not part-time trainers. These are all committed and incredibly educated fitness professionals that know how to get results and have been doing so in NYC for decades.\n\nRESULTS-ORIENTED: Even though this gym has a family atmosphere, it is not touchy feely, It is very New York, which frankly I love and it works for me. Intense, focused but also really compassionate training is how I would describe it. They will match your commitment 110% and if they see you are bringing it hard to a training session, they will be right there to guide and encourage you to achieve more than you thought possible. Proof of this: the training sessions are 1 hour long, but Shawna and Rahim will routinely train 75 or even 90 minutes if their schedules permit when they see you are really putting in the work. Their motivation is infectious and they are committed to seeing your results. Shawna also routinely follows up with text messages on progress.\n\nWELCOMING: Private gyms can be intimidating for some (especially me!) but this place is so down to earth. Famous, non-famous, overweight, fit, young, old, gay, straight, etc....there is a broad cross-section that trains here and everyone is treated the same and made to feel like you belong and are welcome. No attitudes, no judgement.\n\nCLEAN/GOOD AMENITIES: I'm a bit of a hygiene freak and this gym is spotless, also good shower room with Molton Brown products. It has a classic industrial training space vibe which is also cool.\n\nI have spent a lot of money on personal trainers over the last 12 years in NYC, including at the total ripoff Equinox. For those thousands of dollars, I got virtually zero results, pretty apathetic trainers and frankly a lot of poorly informed training advice.\n\nThat changed 4 years ago when I started training at Cordell Fitness. The knowledge, motivation and results I got in the first month alone surpassed anything I had experienced before. I lost 10 pounds in the first month and was feeling stronger than I had in 10 years. I continued training with Shawna and the team for 18 months and at the end had lost 17 pounds and had adopted a much more healthy and active lifestyle outside of the gym too. I maintained that weight loss and fitness level for 2 years but when I took on a new job that had me traveling 2 weeks each month, I struggled to maintain with a disrupted routine and travel schedule. I stopped going to Cordell and I started putting on some weight. When I returned to Cordell I was not met with judgement. I was met with encouragement and enthusiasm to help me get back on track. I have since lost most of the weight I gained and am so grateful to have a place like this -- a place that is such an effective partner in my health,.

            "I had a question regarding my membership fee. Tried to ask the general assistant manager to look into my account and he pretended to not know how to do his job because his shift was almost over. He advised me that he had to email corporate. He finds me in the gym 3 mins after I leave his office telling me that I should've received a email from corporate, I check my email and it was from him. He told me that his shift was ending in in like 6mins. He could have just took my info and just stated that he would look into it the next day. Instead he pretended to not know how/what to do to avoid looking into the account because he was leaving. Not the type of professionalism that you would expect from someone that works at a gym where people are spending almost $400 a month. This establishment really needs to get together especially this location. This gym used to be high quality. Look into going to lifetime because of least half the spas in most of the establishments are functional and they have more amenities for less. I feel like the only location That's worth paying would I pay for this monthly fee is the Hudson yards All the other locations seem to be subpar including the sports location. It was funny, but unprofessional.",

            "When I found out that an Equinox was opening less than 10mins away from my apartment, I was so excited that I would have less of an excuse to skip the gym (my boyfriend would argue that I never had an excuse because the other Equinoxes are a 15 minutes away but whatever) but I am sad to say that I am just a tad disappointed with this location.\n\nLet's start with some pros:\n- This location is close by and I can easily fit a workout in during a busy day.\n- It's clean. I have a weird thing about gym germs and this is the only reason why I pay a premium for Equinox.\n- If you come here at 8am on a weekend or 9pm on a weekday, it's not crowded at all.\n\nNow the cons:\n- If you come here during peak hours or anytime after 8am on the weekends or before 9pm on the weekdays, be prepared to stress tf out.\n- The layout is so weird and it's incredibly cramped.\n- It gets crowded FAST.\n- There is only 1 smith machine, 2 squat racks (I think), 1 squat/deadlift platform and about 8 adjustable benches (excluding the bench press + racks). You better PRAY that the bros are not on their phones taking 10 minutes to \"rest\" in between sets or else you'll be here for hours.\n- Did I mention that this gym is always over capacity? and that it's always crowded?",
            "I had a question regarding my membership fee. Tried to ask the general assistant manager to look into my account and he pretended to not know how to do his job because his shift was almost over. He advised me that he had to email corporate. He finds me in the gym 3 mins after I leave his office telling me that I should've received a email from corporate, I check my email and it was from him. He told me that his shift was ending in in like 6mins. He could have just took my info and just stated that he would look into it the next day. Instead he pretended to not know how/what to do to avoid looking into the account because he was leaving. Not the type of professionalism that you would expect from someone that works at a gym where people are spending almost $400 a month. This establishment really needs to get together especially this location. This gym used to be high quality. Look into going to lifetime because of least half the spas in most of the establishments are functional and they have more amenities for less. I feel like the only location That's worth paying would I pay for this monthly fee is the Hudson yards All the other locations seem to be subpar including the sports location. It was funny, but unprofessional.",

I've been to at least 6 other Crunch Fitness Signature locations across NYC and haven't had this issue. Manager says it's a ClassPass issue but other locations haven't had any issues the 2 or 3 times I've ran a few minutes behind. Manager had the nerve to say he'd have to call the other branch managers to check on their late check-in activity and said this is a habitual thing for me which I found insulting. To add insult to injury, the manager said I could pay $10 for a day pass. Just a demoralizing way to start the day.",

            "Do NOT join this gym. All the prior complaints from other reviewers are absolutely true. I visited the gym in person to cancel my membership because of others' complaints about the gym continuing to charge them after cancelling. I was given a form to fill out by the front desk staff, I filled it out and handed it back to them, and the stuff confirmed that my membership was effectively canceled. I continued to get charged two additional months of membership fees on top of an annual fee after the fact.\n\nI called the gym to figure out what was going on, and James Guzman told me he could neither cancel my membership nor could he find the paperwork I had filled out and signed. Apparently the form was thrown away or mishandled by Crunch. He directed me to Pauline Alfonso who responded in an email that unless I had a copy of the form, which I was never provided with, she would not honor my cancellation date nor would she refund me for the additional wrongful payments. She made no attempts at any sort of solution. I then tried to get in touch with Pauline one the phone to discuss, but James said he had not seen her all day and that she often leaves work early. I asked if there was any way he could try and get in touch with her and he said no. No attempt was made to put me in touch with her at a later time, not even an empty offer to have Pauline call me back. I then emailed the corporate offices (CrunchMS@crunch.com), and never received a response back. I'm not sure what kind of fraudulent business practices are happening and endorsed here, but don't waste your time with this gym as this is clearly a recurring problem.\n\nUpdate: The corporate team refunded the annual fee and one of the wrongfully charged monthly dues, but refused to issue a full refund noting that \"Many times members are informed of the policy and do not actually complete it, so we unfortunately cannot issue a full refund solely on the basis of a claim to have cancelled.\" They are also blaming me for not taking the initiative to ask the staff to scan my ID as proof of my visit (??)

I visited the gym in person to cancel my membership because of others' complaints about the gym continuing to charge them after cancelling.

I continued to get charged two additional months of membership fees on top of an annual fee after the fact.\n\nI called the gym to figure out what was going on, and James Guzman told me he could neither cancel my membership nor could he find the paperwork I had filled out and signed. Apparently the form was thrown away or mishandled by Crunch. He directed me to Pauline Alfonso who responded in an email that unless I had a copy of the form, which I was never provided with, she would not honor my cancellation date nor would she refund me for the additional wrongful payments. She made no attempts at any sort of solution. I then tried to get in touch with Pauline one the phone to discuss, but James said he had not seen her all day and that she often leaves work early. I asked if there was any way he could try and get in touch with her and he said no. No attempt was made to put me in touch with her at a later time, not even an empty offer to have Pauline call me back. I then emailed the corporate offices (CrunchMS@crunch.com), and never received a response back. I'm not sure what kind of fraudulent business practices are happening and endorsed here, but don't waste your time with this gym as this is clearly a recurring problem.\n\nUpdate: The corporate team refunded the annual fee and one of the wrongfully charged monthly dues, but refused to issue a full refund noting that \"Many times members are informed of the policy and do not actually complete it, so we unfortunately cannot issue a full refund solely on the basis of a claim to have cancelled.\" They are also blaming me for not taking the initiative to ask the staff to scan my ID as proof of my visit (??)

            "Do NOT join this gym. All the prior complaints from other reviewers are absolutely true. I visited the gym in person to cancel my membership because of others' complaints about the gym continuing to charge them after cancelling.

I continued to get charged two additional months of membership fees on top of an annual fee after the fact.\n\nI called the gym to figure out what was going on, and James Guzman told me he could neither cancel my membership nor could he find the paperwork I had filled out and signed. Apparently the form was thrown away or mishandled by Crunch. He directed me to Pauline Alfonso who responded in an email that unless I had a copy of the form, which I was never provided with, she would not honor my cancellation date nor would she refund me for the additional wrongful payments. She made no attempts at any sort of solution. I then tried to get in touch with Pauline one the phone to discuss, but James said he had not seen her all day and that she often leaves work early. I asked if there was any way he could try and get in touch with her and he said no. No attempt was made to put me in touch with her at a later time, not even an empty offer to have Pauline call me back. I then emailed the corporate offices (CrunchMS@crunch.com), and never received a response back. I'm not sure what kind of fraudulent business practices are happening and endorsed here, but don't waste your time with this gym as this is clearly a recurring problem.\n\nUpdate: The corporate team refunded the annual fee and one of the wrongfully charged monthly dues, but refused to issue a full refund noting that \"Many times members are informed of the policy and do not actually complete it, so we unfortunately cannot issue a full refund solely on the basis of a claim to have cancelled.\" They are also blaming me for not taking the initiative to ask the staff to scan my ID as proof of my visit (??)

            "All I can say is the place is legit and if you want to hit the bag or even get some mitt rounds in. This is the place to be.\n\nI went to Gleasons since I needed some bag work since I just got to New York. Coming in front desk personal will help you with your needs and charge you for your drop in and from there really you're ready to go. It's fairly an old school boxing gym and has a lot of culture. There was times when I would just mire the pictures all over the gym and really look at the history of how boxing came to be.\n\nI was offered to get some mitt work from one of the trainers but respectfully declined and was thankful though because some gyms just let you come in and out which is the goal overall.\n\nThe gym was pretty busy at the time as well because the nearby hs youth came by for a fundraiser and there was free food and just prizes being given to the youth which was nice to see. I was also able to train near Pro boxers that were being filmed by either Top Rank/Dazn and it was amazing! I really was fanboying it out since I was training there and being surrounded by so much!\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this gym to those who are either starting out in boxing and need a boxing home base near the Brooklyn area but also very friendly to those who just are in town and need a good sweat in or even just learn boxing basics!",
            "Incredible gym in Dumbo We're all the real wrestlers come to work out and spar. Staff is friendly and it's always entertaining.

It's always a pleasure to pop in and talk to Johnny, as he says he's a great storyteller. 60+ years of wrestling, and he has experiences to share.",
            "We've been coming here for years it's so inspirational to see such happy & talented young people learn the art of wrestling. Johnny Rodz Is personable, humble, intelligent, a nice guy and great storyteller. We enjoy hearing about his life and impact on the world of wrestling. I told Johnny that his biography would be a great read & best seller. His office Is packed with memorabilia, photographs, trophies, belts, posters.... Would love it if he would put in a wrestling Hall of Fame in Brooklyn! I took a short video of some of the up-and-coming wrestling stars that we observed and I'm disappointed I can't find a way to put it up here",
            "One needs to understand that the proprietor of this establishment who is named Bruce Silverglade is all about making a profit without putting any money into his establishment.Items such as boxing gloves,hand wraps, and mouth guards are egregiously overpriced, the gym is kept unequivocally filthy with archaic equipment for ones utilization and I've seen fist fights break out here on occasion. Please do not take your valuables to this place as I have had an $80 Muay Thai jump rope and some iPods stolen from me instead of turned in at the front desk. If you are a female, please be aware that these trainers who are using this space make advances at their clients with Devon Cormack who is one of the instructors as one of the main culprits of this practice.",
            "Top tier boxing gym with a rich history. The gym has everything you need to train. From heavy bags to speed bags to doubling bags and other equipment, it lacks nothing.\n\nBefore the gym, I have been training with Darryl Pierre. He is one of many trainers at Gleason's Gym, but I highly recommend him. For the past month (when the gym was closed), he has met with me in the park every day, even in the rain. As important as it is to have a gym with the necessary equipment, it's equally important to have a trainer that's dedicated to helping you improve as a boxer. Darryl isn't in it for the money, he simply has a love for the sport and wants to share it with the community. His rates are affordable. It takes a great trainer to make a good boxer.",
            "Never been happier and more successful here\n\nCame here from my old gym which I was overspending my hard earned cash on with little avail and progress, but I couldn't be happier with the team I'm at right now. Every time I'm learning and each victory/loss is but a stepping stone towards my aspirations",
            "Great gym! Awesome history some press fights for huge fights take place there. It's a awesome place to go for a day or two when you want to change scenery of training. Only negative thing to say is kinda pricy monthly fee not including the trainer fee. Trainers can charge up to 300$ for a month. great if you are a business person who only uses boxing as a getaway sport not the place tho for young kids or teens or adults who want to really learn the art with it being affordable. Not including there weekend kid group programs they do for free !! Overall it's a nice gym I like it!",
            "Well to start off I love this gym and everyone in it , to me it's New York's too boxing gym , but lately management has been really weird !! Just to name a few incidents that's happen to me personally, yesterday on Jan 23 ,2021 I'm on my treadmill doing my normal work out when this Asian looking lady which seems to be running the management side of the gym come to me as tell's to stop running from the treadmill because I'm to heavy for it .. I mean I weight 210pounds .. (don't know if I was being judged on my weight while I'm inside a gym but ok). If the machines are too old to be in that gym then that's a hazardous problem why are they there in the first place.. don't gyms get inspections ? Another incident that happen the same day jan 23 ,2021 around 3:10 - 3:33 which left me traumatized .. I'm inside the Men's locker room getting changed to go home and the same Asian lady walks right into the men's room while me and 3 other men were getting dress with a phone in her hand to show a guy that was in there something on the phone ( are you serious ) first of all how does it even cross your mind to go into the men's locker , second what ever you had to show that man on the phone couldn't had waited till he came out ?? What is going on in there .. I didn't sleep at all just thinking wat I had walking in the woman's locker room i would've been in jail .. not cool .. that gym is amazing and the people in it as well just don't know what's going on with its management team but I hope\nThey fix it ASAP because that gym has to much legacy for one person to mess up it's history ..",
            "Anybody with any love of boxing has heard of Gleason's gym. So, the day comes when I make a long overdue pilgrimage.\n\nIt was EXACTLY what it is cracked up to be. Dirty. Beaten (yet perfectly serviceable) equipment. The rings had little blood stains drizzled all over them. Most of all, goddamn star level talent all around me. Watching some of the workouts in the ring was practically a boxing lesson in and of itself. I worked out on my own for about a half hour.\n\nThen, while chatting with the lady at the front desk (who treated me with the warmth and charm as I were a wayward nephew just returned), I asked how things work with the trainers. She said \"Oh, just find one of those suckers that are sitting around doing nothing and ask them how much they want to get off their ass.\" I tell her that I'm primarily an MMA/Muay Thai guy looking to shape up some technical skill. She assures me that she has just the right person for me.\n\nShe leads me to the back of the gym and points me towards an extremely relaxed looking gentleman eating a bag of chips and says \"That's Chicken. He doesn't look it, but he's one of our best.\" Chicken and I agree a (very reasonable) price, and like Rocky, now I have my own personal Mickey.\n\nChicken, chips still in hand, starts me off with some technical drills for my footwork. Ok, easy enough. Then he has me do them faster, and faster, and keeps going. My legs and calves are on fire. Then, he looks at me and nods approvingly. Now tells me to get my gloves on. He puts down the chips. Now shit gets real. Had hands down the best pad work session of my life. Chicken was merciless. My arms felt like jelly after all the pad work.\n\nNow he tells me that it's time to work on power. So, Chicken has me work a bag strapped to a wall. He sits down, picks the chips back up and starts chatting with one of the other trainers. Meanwhile, I'm pouring in sweat and my arms feel like they're melting. Figuring that Chicken was distracted, I started going a bit easy. Chicken, noticing immediately, just looked at me with a wordless glare of disapproval and asked \"what happened to the heat [in my punches]?\". After what seemed like an eternity, he calls me off the bag and tells me to take my gloves off.\n\nI'm thanking him for the excellent workout, thinking I'm done. Nope. Now he says it's the perfect time for conditioning. So, an eternity of pushups, squats and crunches ensues. After all that is done, now I'm a free man. Chicken finally cracks a smile tells me that he put me through a lot more than what the average walk-in can do because he saw I could handle it, and he was having good time working with me since he really liked the amount of power I was throwing.\n\nAfter hobbling home, I could barely move for two hours. I feel like I got put through a blender and badly taped back together. So, of course, I'm already texting Chicken about when he can train me again. A few months with this guy will turn anyone into a Spartan warrior.\n\nSo, yes. Gleason's is exactly what it is cracked up to be. No BS, no glitz, no fancy equipment, no gimmicks. It doesn't need any of that. It has the most badass fighters and trainers, which is exactly why it is the Mecca of boxing that it is.",
            "This gym has gone really downhill since reopening. No speed bags available, no sparring allowed. They raised the membership fee to 110$ which I understand but I just don't see the gym being worth it at this point in time. Also youre basically on your own unless you decide to pay another 150-300$ a month for a trainer. I will say that before covid, the gym was a lot more useful and these new regulations just don't make it worth my money anymore.",

Just to name a few incidents that's happen to me personally, yesterday on Jan 23 ,2021 I'm on my treadmill doing my normal work out when this Asian looking lady which seems to be running the management side of the gym come to me as tell's to stop running from the treadmill because I'm to heavy for it .. I mean I weight 210pounds .. (don't know if I was being judged on my weight while I'm inside a gym but ok). If the machines are too old to be in that gym then that's a hazardous problem why are they there in the first place.. don't gyms get inspections ? Another incident that happen the same day jan 23 ,2021 around 3:10 - 3:33 which left me traumatized .. I'm inside the Men's locker room getting changed to go home and the same Asian lady walks right into the men's room while me and 3 other men were getting dress with a phone in her hand to show a guy that was in there something on the phone ( are you serious ) first of all how does it even cross your mind to go into the men's locker , second what ever you had to show that man on the phone couldn't had waited till he came out ?? What is going on in there .. I didn't sleep at all just thinking wat I had walking in the woman's locker room i would've been in jail .. not cool .. that gym is amazing and the people in it as well just don't know what's going on with its management team but I hope\nThey fix it ASAP because that gym has to much legacy for one person to mess up it's history ..",
            "Anybody with any love of boxing has heard of Gleason's gym. So, the day comes when I make a long overdue pilgrimage.\n\nIt was EXACTLY what it is cracked up to be. Dirty. Beaten (yet perfectly serviceable) equipment. The rings had little blood stains drizzled all over them. Most of all, goddamn star level talent all around me. Watching some of the workouts in the ring was practically a boxing lesson in and of itself. I worked out on my own for about a half hour.\n\nThen, while chatting with the lady at the front desk (who treated me with the warmth and charm as I were a wayward nephew just returned), I asked how things work with the trainers. She said \"Oh, just find one of those suckers that are sitting around doing nothing and ask them how much they want to get off their ass.\" I tell her that I'm primarily an MMA/Muay Thai guy looking to shape up some technical skill. She assures me that she has just the right person for me.\n\nShe leads me to the back of the gym and points me towards an extremely relaxed looking gentleman eating a bag of chips and says \"That's Chicken. He doesn't look it, but he's one of our best.\" Chicken and I agree a (very reasonable) price, and like Rocky, now I have my own personal Mickey.\n\nChicken, chips still in hand, starts me off with some technical drills for my footwork. Ok, easy enough. Then he has me do them faster, and faster, and keeps going. My legs and calves are on fire. Then, he looks at me and nods approvingly. Now tells me to get my gloves on. He puts down the chips. Now shit gets real. Had hands down the best pad work session of my life. Chicken was merciless. My arms felt like jelly after all the pad work.\n\nNow he tells me that it's time to work on power. So, Chicken has me work a bag strapped to a wall. He sits down, picks the chips back up and starts chatting with one of the other trainers. Meanwhile, I'm pouring in sweat and my arms feel like they're melting. Figuring that Chicken was distracted, I started going a bit easy. Chicken, noticing immediately, just looked at me with a wordless glare of disapproval and asked \"what happened to the heat [in my punches]?\". After what seemed like an eternity, he calls me off the bag and tells me to take my gloves off.\n\nI'm thanking him for the excellent workout, thinking I'm done. Nope. Now he says it's the perfect time for conditioning. So, an eternity of pushups, squats and crunches ensues. After all that is done, now I'm a free man. Chicken finally cracks a smile tells me that he put me through a lot more than what the average walk-in can do because he saw I could handle it, and he was having good time working with me since he really liked the amount of power I was throwing.\n\nAfter hobbling home, I could barely move for two hours. I feel like I got put through a blender and badly taped back together. So, of course, I'm already texting Chicken about when he can train me again. A few months with this guy will turn anyone into a Spartan warrior.\n\nSo, yes. Gleason's is exactly what it is cracked up to be. No BS, no glitz, no fancy equipment, no gimmicks. It doesn't need any of that. It has the most badass fighters and trainers, which is exactly why it is the Mecca of boxing that it is.",

This is the place to be.\n\nI went to Gleasons since I needed some bag work since I just got to New York. Coming in front desk personal will help you with your needs and charge you for your drop in and from there really you're ready to go. It's fairly an old school boxing gym and has a lot of culture. There was times when I would just mire the pictures all over the gym and really look at the history of how boxing came to be.\n\nI was offered to get some mitt work from one of the trainers but respectfully declined and was thankful though because some gyms just let you come in and out which is the goal overall.\n\nThe gym was pretty busy at the time as well because the nearby hs youth came by for a fundraiser and there was free food and just prizes being given to the youth which was nice to see. I was also able to train near Pro boxers that were being filmed by either Top Rank/Dazn and it was amazing! I really was fanboying it out since I was training there and being surrounded by so much!\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this gym to those who are either starting out in boxing and need a boxing home base near the Brooklyn area but also very friendly to those who just are in town and need a good sweat in or even just learn boxing basics!",

            "This gym is overpriced.

I say this as someone who was a member at Equinox for many years. Equinox is no longer the only luxury gym in the area. There's also a Life Time gym opening in 2024 in downtown Brooklyn.

            "It's true. Rich people are just better looking.\n\nIt's never more apparent than when you step foot into an Equinox. All those NYSC members are mole people by comparison.\n\nAnyway, I did a two day trial for all regular locations, and stopped by the Brooklyn Heights location for a pretty extensive workout.\n\nThe place is big with winding floors. If you don't like stairs, tough luck. I was told that they designed it to resemble a brownstone, but that's just marketing mumbo jumbo.\n\nOn the top floor, I did some free weight and cable machine work. They only have two Olympic flat bench stations, which is too few. There's a bunch of adjustable benches for dumbbell workouts though. However, the main reason I would never join Equinox (aside from the ludicrous pricing) is that the dumbbells are horrible. They have this taper at either end of the handle that just digs into your palm. Or at least for me, it was incredibly uncomfortable. Granted, I was using 75lbs ones, but bad design anyway.\n\nI also went down a floor where they have the studio for classes. A LOT of women were walking back and forth from the locker room to the studio in bare feet. Ugh. The second floor was also crowded with trainers taking up space because they don't actually have an open training area.\n\nOther complaints - they only have kettlebells on one floor, and they have no TRX.\n\nThe good things - they have two powerlifting platforms for your deadlifts and the like. And also, when I first went to the locker room, one of the urinals was out of order. And by the time my workout was done, it was fixed. At NYSC down the block, that would've taken at least a month.\n\nOh, and of course, you get all the classic Equinox amenities that they make fun of on Broad City.\n\nOverall, it's a nice gym, but for the price, it should really be perfect.",
            "Hi, Kenny. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We are sharing what you've mentioned with the appropriate teams now.",
            "Got a tour and free few days workouts here. Nice, clean, friendly staff, steam room, other stuff. Asking $225 per month for it is not cool. If i had the money yeah I'd probably go here just because it smells nice but some of the staff are too sexy for their own good. It's a distraction. But I'd recommend.",
            "Aside from the input others have given here (it's really not up to par with Equinox pricing). I joined in 2019 and was given a tour, including the kids club and was told it would reopen as soon as the city allowed childcare to reopen. Several months later, when my kid hit the minimum age, i asked if it would reopen... \"We are still assessing when\". Now I get the answer of \"we'll turn it into a social room instead\". Up until last week the BkHeights webpage still listed the kids club as an amenity.\n\nI feel cheated, and many other parents too. We relied on the promise of a kids club to ensure we could make more flexible use of a $190 gym, but as it stands we can barely make it out. Equinox has been nothing but disingenuous and dismissive on the subject. Frankly, I don't think anyone wants to hangout in a backroom behind the reception either.",

            "It's true. Rich people are just better looking.\n\nIt's never more apparent than when you step foot into an Equinox. All those NYSC members are mole people by comparison.\n\nAnyway, I did a two day trial for all regular locations, and stopped by the Brooklyn Heights location for a pretty extensive workout.\n\nThe place is big with winding floors. If you don't like stairs, tough luck. I was told that they designed it to resemble a brownstone, but that's just marketing mumbo jumbo.\n\nOn the top floor, I did some free weight and cable machine work. They only have two Olympic flat bench stations, which is too few. There's a bunch of adjustable benches for dumbbell workouts though. However, the main reason I would never join Equinox (aside from the ludicrous pricing) is that the dumbbells are horrible. They have this taper at either end of the handle that just digs into your palm. Or at least for me, it was incredibly uncomfortable. Granted, I was using 75lbs ones, but bad design anyway.\n\nI also went down a floor where they have the studio for classes. A LOT of women were walking back and forth from the locker room to the studio in bare feet. Ugh. The second floor was also crowded with trainers taking up space because they don't actually have an open training area.\n\nOther complaints - they only have kettlebells on one floor, and they have no TRX.\n\nThe good things - they have two powerlifting platforms for your deadlifts and the like. And also, when I first went to the locker room, one of the urinals was out of order. And by the time my workout was done, it was fixed. At NYSC down the block, that would've taken at least a month.\n\nOh, and of course, you get all the classic Equinox amenities that they make fun of on Broad City.\n\nOverall, it's a nice gym, but for the price, it should really be perfect.",

            "Up to par in general but... the locker room situation here is officially ridiculous and not acceptable. This still seems to be the only Equinox in NYC that has no keyless locks and no shelving, seating, or interior hooks in the showers that, additionally, are half the size of every other location I've been to.\n\nIt's impossible to use the standard Equinox perks of shave cream and razors without bonking, cutting or contorting yourself, or to dry off without being half out of the stall. No wonder the corridor is always slippery. That's got to suck for staff. And no, handing out crappy loaner locks at the front desk is not a permanent solution for the locker problem.\n\nThere have been complaints about this in comments for some time and nothing has been done. Frankly, it's starting to look like... well, let's say demographic bias. Downtown/South BK deserves the same quality as the UWS or Dumbo. When I signed up, I was told the pandemic had paused franchise expansion in BK. Ok, I get that. Expansion costs a lot. You know what costs less? Changing locker doors and mounting a simple L-shelf in the showers. Let's start with that. How bout it, upper management?",
            "This gym is overpriced.

I say this as someone who was a member at Equinox for many years. Equinox is no longer the only luxury gym in the area. There's also a Life Time gym opening in 2024 in downtown Brooklyn.

The in club perks are okay but the ability to travel and use a club while visiting outweighs the extra $10 or $12 per month.\n\nThis particular club was just okay it felt a little cramped and dark due to the fact that it was in a basement of an older building. It didn't look as clean as some of the other clubs and I go to and this one had a much higher focus on cardio than it did on weights and stationary machines. All in all it was an average planet Fitness.\n\nMy rating system consists of a 3-star being exactly what you expected and neither good nor bad. A 4 means something was extra special and a 5 means you were blown away. A 2 star rating was disappointing and a 1-star rating is terrible",

            "The location is right on Canal and very easy to get to, this location is in the basement so there are no windows or anything. This location may not be the most updated or clean, but it does the job honestly.\n\nStaff is very friendly, they go through and perform the necessary COVID precautions by wiping down the machines and also making sure that there is social distancing at the cardio machines, by blocking off the machines in between. The weight area is harder to social distance, there are markings on the ground but people just take up space where ever they can - so just be careful.\n\nPersonally, I always try my best to go to this gym at off-peak times so that I don't get into issues with being too close to other members. So early mornings are great or late evenings - the hours of operations of this location make it easy to accommodate so it's good.\n\nThis gym is not super nice or great, it just does the job but that is what we paid for! Great price monthly to access some gym equipment and cardio machines, no complaints.",

            "Planet Fitness is an affordable, no frills gym and I am happy to have them as an option in a city where taking care of yourself can require a lot of investment. I used a friends guest pass to work out with her and I think this is a great gym to get the lay of the land in a gym setting (I'm more familiar with classes, so I was a little apprehensive about regulating my form on my own and getting comfortable with machines).\n\nThe basement layout is a little dark and off-putting, but it shouldn't really effect your workout. Peak hours, especially after work, get just as crowded as you expect them to. The machines are in good working order and have clear instructions at each station, getting the hang of things didn't take long at all.\n\nThe place does have a STRONG gym smell. That was off-putting, but I'm not sure what options they have to address it. It's a place where people sweat, but maybe a more robust ventilation system would help. You get used to it once you start contributing to the communal funk :P\n\nFor me, the high traffic of the location takes away from it's convenient proximity to the subway, so I'd probably choose to go elsewhere first, but certainly wouldn't avoid it.",

            "I work around the corner from this gym so it's really convenient that's the first and main reason I decided to check it out. I was once had a membership to PF near my home so I was already familiar with how the gym worked. Went there to check it out and the person at the front desk gave me a run down on the pricing plans and I got a tour, no pressure. You enter on the ground floor but the gym is downstairs. All the equipment is on one floor. The gym is laid out nicely. Multiples of each machine so people aren't hovering over you waiting. They have the 30 minute circuit (this was missing from my previous PF location). The gym is very clean, locker rooms are clean. Staff comes around regularly to clean the area and the machines. Bring your own lock and everything else you may need. There are water fountains.\n\nI took a couple of the classes and they went well. The trainer Jeremy is very nice and helpful. My only issue with the classes is whether you call or sign up online the staff never knows there are people signed up for a class. It's always, oh a class? Um, let me find the trainer. This should be way better organized. They should know if anyone has signed up and the trainer should be ready and waiting.\nBesides that I'm enjoying the gym.",

            "While traveling to New York I stopped at this planet Fitness due to the fact that I have the black membership which allows me to use clubs wherever I go. although it was an average club I would definitely recommend the black card membership to anyone considering a membership at planet Fitness. The in club perks are okay but the ability to travel and use a club while visiting outweighs the extra $10 or $12 per month.\n\nThis particular club was just okay it felt a little cramped and dark due to the fact that it was in a basement of an older building. It didn't look as clean as some of the other clubs and I go to and this one had a much higher focus on cardio than it did on weights and stationary machines. All in all it was an average planet Fitness.\n\nMy rating system consists of a 3-star being exactly what you expected and neither good nor bad. A 4 means something was extra special and a 5 means you were blown away. A 2 star rating was disappointing and a 1-star rating is terrible",

Peak hours, especially after work, get just as crowded as you expect them to. The machines are in good working order and have clear instructions at each station, getting the hang of things didn't take long at all.\n\nThe place does have a STRONG gym smell. That was off-putting, but I'm not sure what options they have to address it. It's a place where people sweat, but maybe a more robust ventilation system would help.

The in club perks are okay but the ability to travel and use a club while visiting outweighs the extra $10 or $12 per month.\n\nThis particular club was just okay it felt a little cramped and dark due to the fact that it was in a basement of an older building. It didn't look as clean as some of the other clubs and I go to and this one had a much higher focus on cardio than it did on weights and stationary machines. All in all it was an average planet Fitness.\n\nMy rating system consists of a 3-star being exactly what you expected and neither good nor bad. A 4 means something was extra special and a 5 means you were blown away. A 2 star rating was disappointing and a 1-star rating is terrible",
            "Hey there, Joe! We apprecaite you taking the time to share your experience and provide us with some feedback. Our goal is to always be improving to create the best fitness experience possible. Thanks for stopping by and we hope to see you again soon!",

            "The location is right on Canal and very easy to get to, this location is in the basement so there are no windows or anything. This location may not be the most updated or clean, but it does the job honestly.\n\nStaff is very friendly, they go through and perform the necessary COVID precautions by wiping down the machines and also making sure that there is social distancing at the cardio machines, by blocking off the machines in between. The weight area is harder to social distance, there are markings on the ground but people just take up space where ever they can - so just be careful.\n\nPersonally, I always try my best to go to this gym at off-peak times so that I don't get into issues with being too close to other members. So early mornings are great or late evenings - the hours of operations of this location make it easy to accommodate so it's good.\n\nThis gym is not super nice or great, it just does the job but that is what we paid for! Great price monthly to access some gym equipment and cardio machines, no complaints.",
            "Thanks for taking the time to ourline your experience, Bonnie! We'd love for you to have a five star experience with us, so please feel free to reach out to our manager with any concerns or suggestions. Thank you!",
            "With exceptions of a sauna or steam room Planet Fitness is well worth the membership, especially their \"Black Card Membership\" option and at a membership price unbeatable (Free weights, massage chair, tanning booths, hydro bed massage, and more) compared to many I have experienced.",
            "It sounds like you're getting the most out of your PF experience, Eric! Your satisfaction always means the world to us here at our Planet. Thank you very much for sharing your kind feedback!",
            "Planet Fitness is an affordable, no frills gym and I am happy to have them as an option in a city where taking care of yourself can require a lot of investment. I used a friends guest pass to work out with her and I think this is a great gym to get the lay of the land in a gym setting (I'm more familiar with classes, so I was a little apprehensive about regulating my form on my own and getting comfortable with machines).\n\nThe basement layout is a little dark and off-putting, but it shouldn't really effect your workout. Peak hours, especially after work, get just as crowded as you expect them to. The machines are in good working order and have clear instructions at each station, getting the hang of things didn't take long at all.\n\nThe place does have a STRONG gym smell. That was off-putting, but I'm not sure what options they have to address it. It's a place where people sweat, but maybe a more robust ventilation system would help. You get used to it once you start contributing to the communal funk :P\n\nFor me, the high traffic of the location takes away from it's convenient proximity to the subway, so I'd probably choose to go elsewhere first, but certainly wouldn't avoid it.",
            "Hi, Luci! We appreciate your honest feedback, and we're glad to offer you a great workout for your fitness needs. We certainly will be looking into some of the concerns you addressed, as we're always looking to improve our Planet and our member experience. Thank you again for your time and for making your voice heard, and we look forward to seeing you again soon!",
            "This Planet Fitness has enough space to work out alone, with your routine. Machines and equipment are always available. No waiting. Staff are seen wiping down machines and replenishing cleaning solution.",
            "Kia, we're glad to hear that you're enjoying the club. Thanks for being a member at Our Planet! To get the most out of your membership, we recommend downloading our app! There are tons of extras such as hours, crowd meter, and touchless check-In:",
            "I work around the corner from this gym so it's really convenient that's the first and main reason I decided to check it out. I was once had a membership to PF near my home so I was already familiar with how the gym worked. Went there to check it out and the person at the front desk gave me a run down on the pricing plans and I got a tour, no pressure. You enter on the ground floor but the gym is downstairs. All the equipment is on one floor. The gym is laid out nicely. Multiples of each machine so people aren't hovering over you waiting. They have the 30 minute circuit (this was missing from my previous PF location). The gym is very clean, locker rooms are clean. Staff comes around regularly to clean the area and the machines. Bring your own lock and everything else you may need. There are water fountains.\n\nI took a couple of the classes and they went well. The trainer Jeremy is very nice and helpful. My only issue with the classes is whether you call or sign up online the staff never knows there are people signed up for a class. It's always, oh a class? Um, let me find the trainer. This should be way better organized. They should know if anyone has signed up and the trainer should be ready and waiting.\nBesides that I'm enjoying the gym."

            "The classes are incredibly difficult, the atmosphere is very niche. If you're looking for a 70s dungeon cocaine den, then this is your spot. If you just wanna work out and not feel like people are staring at you do not come here.",
            "Really nice amenities, but super small gym. I took a yoga class and they don't have like a room or anything so it's out on the turf and the instructor is up in the boxing ring while everyone else works out around you. So not very peaceful and a little cold. Staff were nice though. Bathrooms and showers were beautiful but they marked the locker rooms by chromosomes which was a bio quiz I hadn't studied for, walked into the wrong one.",
            "Ghost is most definitely the best gym I've ever step foot in. The design is out of this world! Every inch of the space, from the lobby to the lockers has been carefully designed to have the luxury touch. I have been a member for over 2 years now and I honestly only have good things to say. The staff is friendly, the trainers are knowledgeable, classes are fun, the equipment is great and the locker rooms make you feel like you're in a spa.\n\nOverall - highly recommended!",
            "Looks like a very cool place from walking by many times. So, when an ad dropped into my IG Feed I was up for it. However, despite twice filling out their online form to try to schedule a tour to signup, and actually dropping by in-person to leave my contact details, I've not heard from them in almost two weeks.\n\nSo, would hate to prejudge, but a gym that doesn't seem all that interested in responding to potential new members, despite running a paid marketing campaign to promote itself, is a bit confusing. Makes me wonder what the rest of the service is like."

It's customary just to Duane reade next door before you go to the gym because the fridge is rarely stocked with water bottles for sale.

Very spacious. The squash area was nice, big and well lit. The competition, for what I heard, is decent. Courts are nice with high ceilings although floors needed washing. It is merely a few blocks from my apt.\nCons: There is no official pro at the club however they have a female member who is giving coaching lessons definitely a step down from other clubs like Nicol Squash, Open, City View or Eastern Athletic. When I visited, there was a shouting match between the \"coach\" and her client, both of them screaming very loudly. Members were visibly upset and said it happens pretty frequently.",

            "I am new to the city and looking to join a good squash club. This review is for Equinox on 61st street. I visited the club around 2 weeks ago.\nPros: Unbelievable facilities, very good gym. Nice pool. Indoor basketball courts with pick up games. They have upscale lockers at an extra cost. Very spacious. The squash area was nice, big and well lit. The competition, for what I heard, is decent. Courts are nice with high ceilings although floors needed washing. It is merely a few blocks from my apt.\nCons: There is no official pro at the club however they have a female member who is giving coaching lessons definitely a step down from other clubs like Nicol Squash, Open, City View or Eastern Athletic. When I visited, there was a shouting match between the \"coach\" and her client, both of them screaming very loudly. Members were visibly upset and said it happens pretty frequently.",

            "Definitely on the smaller end of Equinox clubs, so you won't find as much variety when it comes to equipment. That being said, this club is one of the recently built ones so you will find the latest \"Equinox look\", with wooden elements and dark walls - very sleek and modern. The cycling studio is great, definitely better than the one at the Brooklyn Heights location (better ventilated and cooler). The staff here are always friendly. I love the locker room in this club, it is very spacious and has the toiletries well organized - it is overall very well kept. This is a nice neighborhood Equinox, one of my favorites so far.",
            "This one was pretty good. No lat raise machine though (which is my 5 star criteria).\nOtherwise a perfectly fine location. Locker rooms seemed pretty clean. Workers are really nice.",
            "Nope. Just no. After a long happy 15 year relationship with Crunch, I'm shopping for a new gym and decided to level up. I checked out this Equinox and the LifeTime down the street yesterday morning. Equinox is an NYC mainstay and lifestyle brand so I was pretty shocked seeing it and feeling an overwhelming sense of \"seriously? That's it?\" In fairness I was fresh out of the 4 floor, full spa, basketball court, pool, and sun deck LifeTime ...... but still.\n\nAll of these starts are for Chloe who was super friendly, helpful and upfront with her sales style.\n\nWhile the gym does look cool and there are vacuous looking models roaming around looking for lettuce to eat, it is really small and has nothing more to offer than a Blink or Planet Fitness in terms of equipment ...... but it comes with a WHOPPING price tag of almost $300/month plus a $500 initiation fee for one location. You gotta pay more if you want to use other gyms. Just stop Equinox. I get that your interior design is gorgeous and you likely paid a whole lot for your tile work and edgy interiors (in fairness, gorgeous), but I'd rather spend my money at LifeTime. There is admittedly a lot of beige over there and possibly some fake plants, but the bang for your buck is about 4x. 4 floors of facilites to your one. Less expensive monthly membership, no ridiculous initiation fee, and access to all gyms including Sky with its outdoor pool deck overlooking the river.",
            "It's small for an equinox and it's very easy for it get packed. You have to figure out the right times to go or else you'll easily be spending 2 hours on your workout. Stretching area is tiny. Not enough squat racks or space for that matter. Lately it's been unbelievably busy, to the point where it's not even worth going. But when you pay $220+ for a gym you make it work.\n\nAll other amenities are great and staff is so nice. Showers and sauna are super clean and always well stocked. The classes are really good too. I highly recommend spin on Thursday evenings -she's got the best playlist.\n\nI would suggest a crowd meter on the app that can tell you how busy it is so people can plan their workouts accordingly.\n\nAll in all the only downside to this gym is the size and how crowded it gets.",
            "Probably the worst equinox in nyc. It's very small, not a lot of equipment. The floor is always filthy.\n\nThis biggest let down are the ridiculous hours. They close at 6 on the weekend. 7 on Fridays. 9 m-thurs. the hours makes the gym super packed which ruins the workout experience.\n\nThe showers close even earlier. Don't expect equipment to get fixed either. The incline bench and lat pull down was broken for months.\n\nThe mirrors are warped.. I can't think of why this is a premium gym.\n\nThe good: it's very close to where I live. Bonus: it has dumbbells.",

            "The locker rooms are super nice and clean, the steam room is awesome, and the classes are pretty good. I wish additional times were offered, like 6am or like 7:30pm classes, but overall still pretty solid.\n\nI think what makes it for me is that every single person who works at the desks/in the locker rooms are super friendly and welcoming; usually I feel awkward approaching people to ask questions, but everyone's just super chill. Their trainers are awesome, but staff outside of trainers are also really great.",

            "I've read up on the rest of the reviews on here and- I'm really not sure where all the hate is coming from. I personally love this location.\n\nEQX Dumbo has been my home club for the last three years (by choice). Yes yes yes, the club is small I know. Let's get that complaint out of the way and look at the pros:\n\nIt has:\n\n-a beautiful facility in my opinion.\n-a really good location\n-sparkling clean bathrooms with the most diligent maintenance crew constantly wiping and stocking things up. These people are the true stars here.\n-a really friendly check in desk\n-and most importantly- a family of members who for the most part, know each other on a first name basis.\n\nMany of other clubs I've been to (especially in Manhattan) are\na) dirty or\nb) like JFK airport. New faces walking in and out every day. Maybe that doesn't matter to everyone, but it kinda does to me. I like consistency.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a larger EQX with more amenities and space, then yes go to another location.\n\n*If you're looking for a clean and friendly neighborhood club to -belong- to, EQX Dumbo is your spot.\n\nIt's all just a matter of preference :)",

            "This equinox is located closest to my home in Brooklyn and I like to come here on the weekends when I am home.\nParking is a nuisance and I usually just park in the garage right next to the gym. And use the parking app to get the space a little cheaper.\nWhen you walk in there is a juice press bar downstairs, and the check in desk is right up the stairs. The locker rooms are right past that area, and it is some of the nicer locker rooms that I've seen at equinox. It's very spacious and clean. They have a super nice steam room. Lots of showers. Lots of nice sized lockers.\nThe gym is one floor and it's pretty long, by the entrance are the weights and machines and at the other end is the cardio equipment. When I've been in the gym here it's ever crowded, and there's always room for stretching and foam rolling. Their cardio has the tv on the screen which is great.\nA definite must visit.",

You gotta pay more if you want to use other gyms. Just stop Equinox. I get that your interior design is gorgeous and you likely paid a whole lot for your tile work and edgy interiors (in fairness, gorgeous), but I'd rather spend my money at LifeTime. There is admittedly a lot of beige over there and possibly some fake plants, but the bang for your buck is about 4x. 4 floors of facilites to your one.

            "This equinox is located closest to my home in Brooklyn and I like to come here on the weekends when I am home.\nParking is a nuisance and I usually just park in the garage right next to the gym. And use the parking app to get the space a little cheaper.\nWhen you walk in there is a juice press bar downstairs, and the check in desk is right up the stairs. The locker rooms are right past that area, and it is some of the nicer locker rooms that I've seen at equinox. It's very spacious and clean. They have a super nice steam room. Lots of showers. Lots of nice sized lockers.\nThe gym is one floor and it's pretty long, by the entrance are the weights and machines and at the other end is the cardio equipment. When I've been in the gym here it's ever crowded, and there's always room for stretching and foam rolling. Their cardio has the tv on the screen which is great.\nA definite must visit.",

            "Definitely on the smaller end of Equinox clubs, so you won't find as much variety when it comes to equipment. That being said, this club is one of the recently built ones so you will find the latest \"Equinox look\", with wooden elements and dark walls - very sleek and modern. The cycling studio is great, definitely better than the one at the Brooklyn Heights location (better ventilated and cooler). The staff here are always friendly. I love the locker room in this club, it is very spacious and has the toiletries well organized - it is overall very well kept. This is a nice neighborhood Equinox, one of my favorites so far.",

No matter your fitness level, you will feel welcomed here.",
            "F45 is always a good time! Their instructors always bring the energy and these workouts keep you moving so you don't get bored. How the workouts are formatted, you can choose your own weights, so if you're not getting you ass kicked, it's kinda your own fault.",
            "Love Love Love this place! The trainer's energy is all amazing and they really keep you going even though the workout can be extremely grueling and very tiresome - so be warned! It is a great HIIT workout that mixes in a great variety of muscle work/building too - would recommend you doing the one-week trial and giving it a shot. Although its a class format, but typically if you feel that you need to take a small break or even go a tad slower - that is A-Okay!!!\n\nTrust me I am completely out of shape and I can totally keep up. Everyone at whatever level that they are ALL struggling through these classes and they definitely walk out of the class soaking wet from sweat! The class really promotes camaraderie and its of course if you feel like you can definitely slap hands! They take great COVID precautions by spraying down all the equipment in between classes, so definitely feel comfortable attending the class. I would say once the class starts, you might brush past folks to get to the next station, but everyone is checked to be vaccinated to participate!\n\nI feel very safe here and love the challenging workouts. It is worth the hefty price tag, but honestly, this is something that is actually worth the investment - in yourself! Give it a shot!",
            "I'm obsessed with this location. The instructors are motivating and extremely helpful when showing exercises. The gym itself is gorgeous and clean. It is brand new, on the second floor and has floor to ceiling windows. If you stay consistent with the work outs you will 100% see a difference in your body. Extremely supportive and motivating environment.",
            "Purchased the Intro Offer - Buy 1, Get 2 Free for $36. I was interested in finding a group class near me, but sadly this was not it. Very sorority-feeling, not much of a community; instructors did not provide much guidance and rush the demonstrations.\n\nThe gym is on street level and the entrance opens right into the workout space. There is a small area with a bench that you can sit and cubbies on the opposite side. The lockers and changing rooms are located downstairs with showers.\n\nANGRY BIRD with Christina - This is a strength/weight training class that offers moves to target your arms, chest, and legs. Christina and her assistant firstly go over the different stations (18 stations with different exercises each). Six exercises are in each pod, a total of 3 pods/section. The assistant would demonstrate each exercise with proper form. You do a quick warm-up with a mix of stretches and exercises and go right into the station that they assign you. You do two sets in each station, about 45 seconds each set. After the two sets, you move right into the next station. The class is very fast pace and as a first-timer, I got a bit lost and confused. As you rotate stations, you were supposed to only rotate in that \"pod\" but instead, I just followed the numbers. I wish there was a better introduction especially since there was a handful of first-timers. Christina's assistant did offer some direction and assistance with form. If you ever do forget the exercise in the station, there is a screen right in front that illustrates a short video of each exercise in each station. In the end, I did feel like I got a great workout.\n\nOver the course of a week, I have also done Hollywood with Lil Aronoff/Christina Esposito and Foxtrot with Isabella Ward/Christina Esposito. Hollywood is the signature workout of F45, which is a 60 minute class with a D.J. This would be the class for everyone if you are a first timer. But other than that, I was disappointed with my experience at F45 Lower East Side.\n\nI have a few critiques. Firstly, there are too many names of classes and similar descriptions. I was very confused when I booked my class. I wish they could simplify the list of classes or at least categorize them into cardio, strength, and so on, so that it would be easier to decide which class to sign up for.\n\nMy second critique is that the class feels very much sorority-like. Let me explain. The instructors were always giddy with each other and rather than providing any direction and correction (you can see people were struggling with some of the exercises and the form was not correct), they would be chatting up the same 1-2 students who I believe may be regulars. They rushed through the exercise demonstrations and due to the lack of direction, I had injured my lower back, which I had mentioned to them prior to class. It felt as if the instructors were more into themselves and the giddiness just reminds me of a sorority gathering.\n\nI probably will not be returning to this location. Very disappointed based on the rave reviews.",
            "F45 is so, so great. I really love coming here for challenging strength workouts. I'm often training for marathons so I'm usually just running, but coming here to get stronger has been a game changer for me. I was looking for a break from my lifting routine at the gym, and these group classes really hit the mark and helped me change it up.\n\nThe trainers are great and motivating, the amenities and equipment are top notch, & the workouts themselves are always evolving and modifiable, which I love. I honestly feel so good after I take a class here. I also live right around the corner so it's really convenient.\n\nI totally understand why they charge as much as they do, and they should--the value is there. I can't afford to always be taking classes here, but I absolutely would if I could. When I can, I do buy a pack and sprinkle them throughout my normal running schedule. Maybe one day I'll splurge on the monthly :) Highly recommend if you want to get stronger and feel great!",

            "DIRTY. First and last time I will be to Crunch-Tribeca. I forgot my shoes so I decided to do the steam room and sauna. The sauna looked like it was built by an amateur carpenter and screw heads were sticking out all over. The sauna room smelled like mildew and the steam was suffocating.\nThen I took a shower and to start, one shower had a COCKROACH and all the others were just plain dirty. There was either hair everywhere or soap all over the mats. I ended up showering in socks because they were that bad. I was showering by 7 am, they should have been clean, they were only open for an hour. Then it seems the soaps were refilled with different soaps because they didn't smell anything like the usual soap. Mind you, I shower at Crunch 3-4 times a week because I go straight to work after, you get used to the smell. Also, the conditioner was watered down.\nThen when I went to the get-ready area, the counters were filthy, I had to put paper towels down under my items in the counter.\n\n0/10 - would not recommend",

            "I was in NYC for a week, and since I temporarily didn't have access to a gym while traveling (I use 24 Hour Fitness back at home, since it's cheap but at least gets the job done), I browsed around on Yelp, found the Tribeca branch of Crunch Fitness, and called on a Monday morning around 6am to see if I could try the gym for a free day pass. The receptionist was really kind, and said yes. So, I headed over for my morning workout, and she gave me access to the gym. I couldn't access wifi because I wasn't a member, but oh well, at least I got my workout done.

I thought it was a good deal, so I went with it.\n\n........Only to be appalled that all the additional fees my card was charged with upfront came out to almost $200. After feeling scammed AF and letting my rage surge and boil through me, I exploded into a dispute with Crunch Fitness over the phone.

            "Prior to the pandemic, I had a NYC Parks Department gym membership. For $150 a year, I was able to go to any NYC Parks Department gym in the city. After the nightmare began in March 2020, every gym in the city was forced to shut down. In September 2020, private gyms were allowed to reopen. Unfortunately for me, the NYC Parks Department gyms remained closed. I had two choices: Get a membership for a private gym or turn into a couch potato. I chose the former. I joined Crunch Rochdale since it's a 20 minute walk from where I live. NYC Parks Department gyms eventually reopened, but with reduced hours that aren't convenient for me. I remained with Crunch.\n\nLong story short, I started a part time job in Tribeca. After my first day at the job, I felt like working out before I got home, not after. I stopped by Crunch Tribeca. Since Tribeca is a Signature Club (i.e. a club located in an upscale neighborhood), I had to pay a $10 surcharge.\n\nThis gym is much bigger than my home gym. However, the machines are basically the same. There are just more of them. In order to reach the locker room and weight room, you have to walk down stairs (which was a pain in the ass for me since I have bad knees). Since the building is old, there are a lot of hidden hazards (and lawsuits waiting to happen). You have to be careful where you're walking or lifting.\n\nThe gym was clean.

            "I was in NYC for a week, and since I temporarily didn't have access to a gym while traveling (I use 24 Hour Fitness back at home, since it's cheap but at least gets the job done), I browsed around on Yelp, found the Tribeca branch of Crunch Fitness, and called on a Monday morning around 6am to see if I could try the gym for a free day pass. The receptionist was really kind, and said yes. So, I headed over for my morning workout, and she gave me access to the gym. I couldn't access wifi because I wasn't a member, but oh well, at least I got my workout done. I was pleased with the selection of weights, barbells, and equipments while I was there, and impressed by how clean everything was, probably because I'm used to 24 Hour Fitness.\n\nWhile I was there getting my workout, a sales rep, John, called me while I was still in the gym to ask me if I'd be interested in paying $70/month. We met up in person, and he even asked me a few times to give me his credit card, and even when I needed to get going ASAP and go shower because I needed to get to work ASAP, he was like, \"I can take your credit card! It'll take me two seconds!\"\n\n*breaks out singing*\nNo, I don't want to give you my (credit card) number.\nNo, I don't want to give you mine and\nNo, I don't want to meet you nowhere\nNo, I don't want none of your time\n*off-key singing over*\n\nAfter enjoying a hasty shower (I do love they use Ritual for shampoo, condition, bodywash, and lotion), I booked it out of there like running from a plague.\n\nThe next day, while I was at work, I got an email and phone call from another of their sales rep, Adam Kaplan. He gave me a deal that I can get the rest of February free, be charged $105 for the month of March, and if I cancel in March, I can get through April free. I thought it was a good deal, so I went with it.\n\n........Only to be appalled that all the additional fees my card was charged with upfront came out to almost $200. After feeling scammed AF and letting my rage surge and boil through me, I exploded into a dispute with Crunch Fitness over the phone. The target of my angry phone call, the operations manager Camille, was very polite and courteous and understanding. She escalated my situation to the higher-ups, and told me to expect a response tomorrow.\n\nLater that evening, I got an email from Adam, who said, \"I was told you were upset, I'd love to make some time to discuss this with you tomorrrow.\"\n\n*back to singing off-key*\nNo, I don't want to meet you nowhere\nNo, I don't want none of your time\nAnd No, I don't want no scrub\nA scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me\n*90s nostalgia over*\n\nI didn't bother responding to his email and voicemail. Oh, he also called and emailed me AGAIN the following morning, like a crazed ex trying to find closure.

She checked with the higher ups again, and told me they approved to give me a full refund which should be back on my card early next week, canceled my membership, and wouldn't charge me for any future fees. That was what I wanted, so thank you very much Camille for handling this situation so professionally! She and the receptionist Evan were the best parts of this gym.\n\nFor curiosity's sake, I also searched \"Adam\" in the search bar for past reviews mentioning him, and apparently I'm the third reviewer who had a negative experience.

            "Prior to the pandemic, I had a NYC Parks Department gym membership. For $150 a year, I was able to go to any NYC Parks Department gym in the city. After the nightmare began in March 2020, every gym in the city was forced to shut down. In September 2020, private gyms were allowed to reopen. Unfortunately for me, the NYC Parks Department gyms remained closed. I had two choices: Get a membership for a private gym or turn into a couch potato. I chose the former. I joined Crunch Rochdale since it's a 20 minute walk from where I live. NYC Parks Department gyms eventually reopened, but with reduced hours that aren't convenient for me. I remained with Crunch.\n\nLong story short, I started a part time job in Tribeca. After my first day at the job, I felt like working out before I got home, not after. I stopped by Crunch Tribeca. Since Tribeca is a Signature Club (i.e. a club located in an upscale neighborhood), I had to pay a $10 surcharge.\n\nThis gym is much bigger than my home gym. However, the machines are basically the same. There are just more of them. In order to reach the locker room and weight room, you have to walk down stairs (which was a pain in the ass for me since I have bad knees). Since the building is old, there are a lot of hidden hazards (and lawsuits waiting to happen). You have to be careful where you're walking or lifting.\n\nThe gym was clean.

            "I was in NYC for a week, and since I temporarily didn't have access to a gym while traveling (I use 24 Hour Fitness back at home, since it's cheap but at least gets the job done), I browsed around on Yelp, found the Tribeca branch of Crunch Fitness, and called on a Monday morning around 6am to see if I could try the gym for a free day pass. The receptionist was really kind, and said yes. So, I headed over for my morning workout, and she gave me access to the gym. I couldn't access wifi because I wasn't a member, but oh well, at least I got my workout done. I was pleased with the selection of weights, barbells, and equipments while I was there, and impressed by how clean everything was, probably because I'm used to 24 Hour Fitness.\n\nWhile I was there getting my workout, a sales rep, John, called me while I was still in the gym to ask me if I'd be interested in paying $70/month. We met up in person, and he even asked me a few times to give me his credit card, and even when I needed to get going ASAP and go shower because I needed to get to work ASAP, he was like, \"I can take your credit card! It'll take me two seconds!\"\n\n*breaks out singing*\nNo, I don't want to give you my (credit card) number.\nNo, I don't want to give you mine and\nNo, I don't want to meet you nowhere\nNo, I don't want none of your time\n*off-key singing over*\n\nAfter enjoying a hasty shower (I do love they use Ritual for shampoo, condition, bodywash, and lotion), I booked it out of there like running from a plague.\n\nThe next day, while I was at work, I got an email and phone call from another of their sales rep, Adam Kaplan. He gave me a deal that I can get the rest of February free, be charged $105 for the month of March, and if I cancel in March, I can get through April free. I thought it was a good deal, so I went with it.\n\n........Only to be appalled that all the additional fees my card was charged with upfront came out to almost $200. After feeling scammed AF and letting my rage surge and boil through me, I exploded into a dispute with Crunch Fitness over the phone. The target of my angry phone call, the operations manager Camille, was very polite and courteous and understanding. She escalated my situation to the higher-ups, and told me to expect a response tomorrow.\n\nLater that evening, I got an email from Adam, who said, \"I was told you were upset, I'd love to make some time to discuss this with you tomorrrow.\"\n\n*back to singing off-key*\nNo, I don't want to meet you nowhere\nNo, I don't want none of your time\nAnd No, I don't want no scrub\nA scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me\n*90s nostalgia over*\n\nI didn't bother responding to his email and voicemail.

            "My goal is to visit as many Blink gyms in NYC.\n\nLocation: upstairs\nElevator: yes\nConvenience: in Noho, close to 6, R, W, B, D, F, M subways\nGym Size: on the smaller side, \"Long\", shaped like a \"L\"\nLocker Room Size: very small\nEquipment (outside of the basics mentioned below): sandbags, heavy Kettlebells (60, 70lbs), TRX, battle ropes\nCrowdedness: I tend to go afternoons. Manageable but was told Monday is the worst and after 5pm nights crowded\nCleanliness: One of the cleaner Blinks out there.\nStaff Friendliness: Good\nHours: 7 days/wk. On par with other NYC Blinks.\nOverall: Solid gym in my \"rotation\"; Very clean despite a very small locker room. Bright as it is upstairs and there are actual windows. Never really need to wait for a machine outside of bicep curl machine. Crowd seems to be NYU students and people stealing an hour from work\n\n*Unless noted, assume all Blink gyms have locker rooms, water fountain, stretch area, dumbbells, kettlebells (up to 50lbs), smith machines, weight machines, cardio equipment (Rower, treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, stairclimber), showers, wipes, Towel machine (pay separate charge). Assume you can scan in via App or Apple Wallet/Watch\n\n**Note: I am a Blink user with entry possibility of all their NYC area gyms via an Add-on to my Classpass membership. (I did not want to deal with Blink corporate in case I needed to cancel and wanted to avoid a startup fee or annual charge). I do not take showers at the gym and tend to go off-peak hours.",
            "With the relative fall of NYSC (with at least six key locations closing in the past couple years), I have been trying to find gyms in the downtown NYC area that fall under my current Gympass program, and Blink Fitness is one of them. This Noho location is fairly centralized, right off Broadway near the West Village and Soho.\n\nThe gym is located on the second floor of a building that used to house (among other things) Tower Records. There is both a staircase and elevator that will get you up to the second floor. The first floor is an open area that includes a few seats if you're waiting for someone.\n\nUpstairs the facility is fairly cramped due to the limited space available. I'm not necessarily saying you will be on top of other people, but it's pretty darn close. If you're trying to do any sort of calisthenics or anything involving wide movements, take it slow or you might wind up elbowing someone by accident. There are six distinct areas in this gym: the locker rooms, cardio machine area, personal training area (complete with mats and kettle bells), stretch area, weight machines and free weights area. Given the limited space, I am impressed at just how much equipment the gym managed to fit into the gym floor. They have all the equipment you will need for a good workout.\n\nThe staff is efficient and good about answering questions. They also do a good job of keeping the gym floor organized (though I will also partially credit the gym members too). The locker room is also kept clean and organized. I am happy this location is here.",

            "This afternoon as I was in the locker room changing my clothing to leave, I smelled a strong smell of weed. A member in back of me was rolling a large joint on the bench. This annoyed me. I feel he should not be allowed to exercise at Blink Fitness!",
            "Pretty decent gym, bright and cheery, and about as clean you could want given everything is in constant use. They have actual free weights: full set of dumbells from 10lb up as well as barbells, squat racks (2), deadlift plates, and bench press (2). There's no light bar, but there's a set of fixed-weight bars up to 65lb. I go at off hours, so it's not too crowded.\n\nI got my Blink membership through the ClassPass app (which has a combo membership option) so hopefully I won't run into the cancellation problems other people have noted here.\n\nMain thing I would suggest to the location is to disconnect the deadlift platforms from the squat racks slightly and buy two more barbells. That would instantly double their barbell lifting capacity: there's no reason one person needs to occupy both simultaneously, except they set it up that way.",

There is both a staircase and elevator that will get you up to the second floor. The first floor is an open area that includes a few seats if you're waiting for someone.\n\nUpstairs the facility is fairly cramped due to the limited space available. I'm not necessarily saying you will be on top of other people, but it's pretty darn close. If you're trying to do any sort of calisthenics or anything involving wide movements, take it slow or you might wind up elbowing someone by accident. There are six distinct areas in this gym: the locker rooms, cardio machine area, personal training area (complete with mats and kettle bells), stretch area, weight machines and free weights area. Given the limited space, I am impressed at just how much equipment the gym managed to fit into the gym floor. They have all the equipment you will need for a good workout.\n\nThe staff is efficient and good about answering questions.

I go at off hours, so it's not too crowded.\n\nI got my Blink membership through the ClassPass app (which has a combo membership option) so hopefully I won't run into the cancellation problems other people have noted here.\n\nMain thing I would suggest to the location is to disconnect the deadlift platforms from the squat racks slightly and buy two more barbells. That would instantly double their barbell lifting capacity: there's no reason one person needs to occupy both simultaneously, except they set it up that way.",

            "It's not bad.... Like I actually like the gym- it's what you pay for and it's cheap. Nothing special. It can get pretty crowded as expected so I'd advise going between 9-11 am or 8pm-close. That's when it's the emptiest and you can actually get a bench or machine.\n\nWhat I don't like... is the staff. They do entirely too much. You're apparently not allowed to wear slides because it's a \"hazard\" so they literally kicked me out- mid workout.... Like you couldn't have let me finish..? Quite ridiculous... I've paid more at other gyms... and they've said nothing. Plus... I came in multiple times before... with slides on... no one said anything. I'm not barefoot... I have on slides... but okay. The reviews you read about the staff are unfortunately accurate... I ignored them but just be aware. I wouldn't say it's enough to not get a membership- especially if you're trying to avoid the crowd of students in the student gyms at 404 (if you go to nyu).",
            "With the relative fall of NYSC (with at least six key locations closing in the past couple years), I have been trying to find gyms in the downtown NYC area that fall under my current Gympass program, and Blink Fitness is one of them. This Noho location is fairly centralized, right off Broadway near the West Village and Soho.\n\nThe gym is located on the second floor of a building that used to house (among other things) Tower Records. There is both a staircase and elevator that will get you up to the second floor. The first floor is an open area that includes a few seats if you're waiting for someone.\n\nUpstairs the facility is fairly cramped due to the limited space available. I'm not necessarily saying you will be on top of other people, but it's pretty darn close. If you're trying to do any sort of calisthenics or anything involving wide movements, take it slow or you might wind up elbowing someone by accident. There are six distinct areas in this gym: the locker rooms, cardio machine area, personal training area (complete with mats and kettle bells), stretch area, weight machines and free weights area. Given the limited space, I am impressed at just how much equipment the gym managed to fit into the gym floor. They have all the equipment you will need for a good workout.\n\nThe staff is efficient and good about answering questions.

Let alone at intermediate... I was seeing stars!\n\nNon stop action but such a great workout! Always come out of the class feeling 10x stronger. Friendly staff and attendees!",
            "Thanks Auden, we're glad you've enjoyed both the Intro & the Intermediate level on the Turf. See you next time!",
            "So ecstatic to be invited to this elite, black owned gym for a ladies full body class!!! I would've never known it existed and it is absolutely worth the review & $$$.\nNot only was the location elite but the routines and fact that we were delicately pushed to exceed our limits. I felt catered to and supported from instruction to the final outdoor run. Some of the equipment & workout was new to me & I love being wow'd by new things that elevate me.\nIn later receiving emails from them I learned they host indoor & outdoor community scrimmages - super cool! I def will be trying one in the spring.\nIt has an appeal of it being a solid place to build your network or host groups.\nDid I mention the founder is so hot? Very proud of him bringing this quality to the area. As a branding person I can say Tone House is truly set apart from the rest in every way. Support this business! Get toned!\nGo, enjoy!!!",
            "Hi A'Yanna, thanks for sharing your experience on the Turf! We're glad you enjoyed your class and felt safely & successfully pushed past your limits. We hope to see you for your second class or in one of our community events soon!",
            "Super fun but tough classes! Think high school Varsity sports conditioning, ramped up by 500%. The coaches are so knowledgeable, encouraging and attentive.",
            "Thanks, Rose! See you on the Turf again soon.",
            "Everybody was super friendly and encouraging, pushing you to succeed, maybe a bit too much. It is NOT beginner friendly. The trainer kept encouraging me to lift/pull at whatever weight they have on and seemed confused and was pretty reluctant in lowering the weights for me. This is a safety issue. There was no time to rest at all, my body was not feeling good, there was no time to catch your breath cause you're onto the next exercise right away.\n\nAlso the showers in the women's locker room is a bit odd. It is right in front of the hallways, where everybody passes through. Hooks are outside so you have to crack open the door to get your towel, no hooks inside so you have come out in your towel and hope no men pass by cause they have full view.",
            "Well run, clean facility, draws a fit and enthusiastic crowd, fun, decent music. Instruction for each exercise to be taken at different levels. Confidence and muscle builder. Only drawback is that it is a bit pricey. But go check it out.",
            "Thanks Emilia, glad you enjoyed the facility and the workout! See you next time!",
            "So INTENSE!! Great experience that I highly recommend. The classes were a bit expensive for 2 people it was $97. The classes last 60 minutes each. They're drill style so they basically train you like a pro athlete but in different levels. We did the intermediate class with Zack. He KILLED IT!!! He was extremely motivating and great with remembering names.\n\nIf you want something that will make you feel the burn in a good way and show you results I highly highly recommend. My friend has been going here for years and dragged me along. I'd definitely do it again. They also you to stop and take breaks, but you feel motivated to keep going because it's drill style. There's someone behind you and in front of you. You get out into teams and everyone is super nice and encouraging.\n\nThere's a warm up area, there are showers, there's also an ice bath tub area and the women's locker room. There's a turd field which is where you workout (it's indoors). They have beverages for purchase, snacks, and athletic wear for the brand. They partner with tons of brands including Lululemon. I got a cute sports bra that's Lululemon and tone house partnered.",
            "Hey Trendy! You absolutely crushed your first class and it was a pleasure to have you on the Turf. We're glad you enjoyed the Intermediate program, sounds like it was the perfect level for you to start! Heads up that our Rookie Pass would have included 2 classes for the price of 1 - if you'd like to take advantage of a second class feel free to email info@tonehouse.com and we'll set you up. See you for round two soon!",
            "This workout is TOUGH. Their conditioning class was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Lots of burpees, squats, sprints (including sprinting while attached to a bungee cord), sled pushes, etc. Love the group workout dynamics even though it can be a bit intimidating at first. Will definitely be back!",
            "Thanks, Christina! Tough, but doable is the name of our game. Glad you enjoyed and see you next time!",
            "If walking into this gym isn't intimidating enough, the dramatic, reality competition show music a la Survivor playing in the low lit waiting area is more than enough to heighten the fear factor (wow these references are aging me). If there's a class taking place ahead of yours, you'll hear the groans of pain and exhaustion coming from class-goers while the instructor shouts at them to get in formation, which will only increase your anxiety about going in. At Tone House, no one goes easy on you.\n\nThe warm up alone will leave you gasping for air, with multiple sets of burpees, high knees, leaps, and jumping across the turf and little rest in between rounds. Throughout class you'll do things like drag a heavy sled across the turf, use val slides, and do this horrible move called a gallup, which will make you want to call it quits not even mid-way through the class.\n\nI know I make it sound like pure torture, which it is, but if you're someone who chases endorphin highs, this is a class that will deliver it to you as soon as it's over. There is an encouraging, team spirit environment where your teammates clap and cheer you on to get to the finish line. Everyone in that room, no matter their fitness level, finds the workout challenging, so they understand your struggle.

            "Hey Morlene, thaks for coming to workout with us. We're glad you felt challenged but supported throughout the class. The encouraging and team-oriented environment is something we aim to provide in every class, and we're glad you enjoyed. Hope to see you back on the Turf soon!",
            "Really energizing class, great instructor and amazing workout sequence. Will definitely come back for more.",
            "Attended several of these classes via classpass!\n\nIf you're looking for a HIIT class that whoops you, this is the class you want to take!\n\nEven at beginner, it's intense! Let alone at intermediate... I was seeing stars!\n\nNon stop action but such a great workout! Always come out of the class feeling 10x stronger. Friendly staff and attendees!",
            "Thanks Auden, we're glad you've enjoyed both the Intro & the Intermediate level on the Turf. See you next time!",
            "So ecstatic to be invited to this elite, black owned gym for a ladies full body class!!! I would've never known it existed and it is absolutely worth the review & $$$.\nNot only was the location elite but the routines and fact that we were delicately pushed to exceed our limits. I felt catered to and supported from instruction to the final outdoor run. Some of the equipment & workout was new to me & I love being wow'd by new things that elevate me.\nIn later receiving emails from them I learned they host indoor & outdoor community scrimmages - super cool! I def will be trying one in the spring.\nIt has an appeal of it being a solid place to build your network or host groups.\nDid I mention the founder is so hot? Very proud of him bringing this quality to the area. As a branding person I can say Tone House is truly set apart from the rest in every way. Support this business! Get toned!\nGo, enjoy!!!",
            "Hi A'Yanna, thanks for sharing your experience on the Turf! We're glad you enjoyed your class and felt safely & successfully pushed past your limits. We hope to see you for your second class or in one of our community events soon!",
            "Super fun but tough classes! Think high school Varsity sports conditioning, ramped up by 500%. The coaches are so knowledgeable, encouraging and attentive.",
            "Thanks, Rose! See you on the Turf again soon.",
            "Everybody was super friendly and encouraging, pushing you to succeed, maybe a bit too much. It is NOT beginner friendly. The trainer kept encouraging me to lift/pull at whatever weight they have on and seemed confused and was pretty reluctant in lowering the weights for me. This is a safety issue. There was no time to rest at all, my body was not feeling good, there was no time to catch your breath cause you're onto the next exercise right away.\n\nAlso the showers in the women's locker room is a bit odd. It is right in front of the hallways, where everybody passes through. Hooks are outside so you have to crack open the door to get your towel, no hooks inside so you have come out in your towel and hope no men pass by cause they have full view.",
            "Well run, clean facility, draws a fit and enthusiastic crowd, fun, decent music. Instruction for each exercise to be taken at different levels. Confidence and muscle builder. Only drawback is that it is a bit pricey. But go check it out.",
            "Thanks Emilia, glad you enjoyed the facility and the workout! See you next time!",
            "So INTENSE!! Great experience that I highly recommend. The classes were a bit expensive for 2 people it was $97. The classes last 60 minutes each. They're drill style so they basically train you like a pro athlete but in different levels. We did the intermediate class with Zack. He KILLED IT!!! He was extremely motivating and great with remembering names.\n\nIf you want something that will make you feel the burn in a good way and show you results I highly highly recommend. My friend has been going here for years and dragged me along. I'd definitely do it again. They also you to stop and take breaks, but you feel motivated to keep going because it's drill style. There's someone behind you and in front of you. You get out into teams and everyone is super nice and encouraging.\n\nThere's a warm up area, there are showers, there's also an ice bath tub area and the women's locker room. There's a turd field which is where you workout (it's indoors). They have beverages for purchase, snacks, and athletic wear for the brand. They partner with tons of brands including Lululemon. I got a cute sports bra that's Lululemon and tone house partnered.",
            "Hey Trendy! You absolutely crushed your first class and it was a pleasure to have you on the Turf. We're glad you enjoyed the Intermediate program, sounds like it was the perfect level for you to start! Heads up that our Rookie Pass would have included 2 classes for the price of 1 - if you'd like to take advantage of a second class feel free to email info@tonehouse.com and we'll set you up. See you for round two soon!",
            "This workout is TOUGH. Their conditioning class was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Lots of burpees, squats, sprints (including sprinting while attached to a bungee cord), sled pushes, etc. Love the group workout dynamics even though it can be a bit intimidating at first. Will definitely be back!",
            "Thanks, Christina! Tough, but doable is the name of our game. Glad you enjoyed and see you next time!",
            "If walking into this gym isn't intimidating enough, the dramatic, reality competition show music a la Survivor playing in the low lit waiting area is more than enough to heighten the fear factor (wow these references are aging me). If there's a class taking place ahead of yours, you'll hear the groans of pain and exhaustion coming from class-goers while the instructor shouts at them to get in formation, which will only increase your anxiety about going in. At Tone House, no one goes easy on you.\n\nThe warm up alone will leave you gasping for air, with multiple sets of burpees, high knees, leaps, and jumping across the turf and little rest in between rounds. Throughout class you'll do things like drag a heavy sled across the turf, use val slides, and do this horrible move called a gallup, which will make you want to call it quits not even mid-way through the class.\n\nI know I make it sound like pure torture, which it is, but if you're someone who chases endorphin highs, this is a class that will deliver it to you as soon as it's over.

            "This workout is TOUGH. Their conditioning class was one of the hardest things I've ever done.

There is an encouraging, team spirit environment where your teammates clap and cheer you on to get to the finish line. Everyone in that room, no matter their fitness level, finds the workout challenging, so they understand your struggle.

            "Chances are, if you're reading this review, you're either looking for a gym to go to or you've heard the rumors about Planet Fitness. I can say once and for all, the rumors are false, well for the Planet Fitness gym's that I've gone to at least. People don't judge or degrade you here, instead they help you out and compliment you on your physique.\nIf you're looking for a good gym that doesn't get too busy most of the times, come visit this one! Its the last stop on the M15 Bus or just take the 1 train to the last stop, which is South Ferry or take the 4 or 5 train to Bowling Green, or lastly, take the N, R or W train to Whitehall Street. It's also located right to to the Bull statue.\nThis gym in particular is very big and spacious. They have three floors. Top floor is the lobby/check in, second floor are where the cardio machines, 30 minute hit course machines and massage/black card member amenities are at. The last and final floor is where you'll see everyone at. That's where all the smith machines and free weights are at. That's also where the lockers are located and might I add that the lockers have amazing looking showers. The showers are not like your typical showers with curtains, these showers have a glass door to them (not a see through glass door for obvious reasons) but they're probably the best Planet Fitness showers that you will ever see.",

            "Worst club ever overall representing is bad in all questions. Got signed up a contract after 1 time visit i absolutely didn't like it as it was filthy stinky and over crowded to make your self to the weights you would have to wait 1/2 hour or even more. After requested cancellation they're telling me that i can't cancel because I signed up for something i don't even know i just wanna need to sign up for the club. Now i have to pay a lot of money to make them cancel it! Absolutely ridiculous, I'm my opinion I got scammed and because the clubs are so awful that's the new way of robbing people so they wouldn't be quitting.\n\n0 stars!!!",
            "We're concerned to hear about that, Vadim.This certainly isn't the way we want our members to feel. We always want our members to be able to gym confidently and comfortably! From the front door to the back of our Judgement Free Zone\u00ae, we always strive to keep our Planet clean and comfortable for the safety and satisfaction of our PF family! We hate to see you leave our PF family. If you signed up for a Commitment Membership, there is a $58 buyout fee for canceling the membership before the 12 months are fulfilled. Also, any outstanding balances must be settled upon cancellation as well. If you have any billing concerns, we kindly ask you to bring them to the manager, as they are the best point of contact for billing matters.",
            "Keep changing their time like Chameleon, it's annoying. It's not a customer's interest. I was happy before that as I get up early in the morning like 4 am thereafter I go home ready for my office work. But now they changed time ( from 5 am to 11pm ) . They removed my exercise completely from my life. They don't consider customer's demand. Atleast they opened from 4 to 11pm for customers convenience\nSame PF company said during covid time \"On January 1st, 2020, Planet Fitness changed their hours of operation. They are now open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This change was made in response to customer feedback and demand.\" NOW WHA HAPPEND? All of a sudden customers changed their views ? Since I unable to play here onwards due to their time change I can give them 1 star , (Zero would be appropriate)",
            "Been to this location a few times while in the area. Definitely better locations in NYC. Kind of difficult to navigate. The black card spa is in the open rather than a seperate room. Staff 4 stars. But I have to say I think this location has the nicest locker rooms!!",

            "This gym absolutely sucks, but everytime I think wow this place is awful, I remind myself I'm paying 10 dollars a month. For less than a dollar a gym visit, I'm not sure what I should expect more than a functional treadmill.\n\nThis gym smells horrible, is wildly overcrowded, and has some genuinely sus clients. Pf is supposed to not have \"hunks\" , and yet that seems to be 40% of this gyms clients. There was a gentlemen the other day who had an entire skull cap tattoo. Have seen several people who appeared to be homeless.\n\nBut again, 10 dollars a month. I basically just accept ill never use the weight area and resign to paying 50 cent a trip for a treadmill.\n\nShould probably consider raising their prices.",
            "So, you get what you pay for. PF/Wall Street is $15/month. Great price.\n\nFirst, the pros: Huge place, 2 floors, lots of weight machines and no real logjams except during rush hour from 5 - 7 PM. Probably over 100 cardio machines -- bikes, ellipticals, etc. Staff has always been pleasant.\n\nCons: The locker room is huge, but mostly very dark, and it's getting harder every day to find a locker, since about half of them are busted from being pried open and broken into. Yes, that's right. That, along with the fact that it seems like there are a few homeless guys regularly spending much of the day in the locker room, doesn't give one a sense of safety or security. If you leave valuables in the locker room (in a locked locker), you're asking for trouble.\n\nAlas, this last part has become a dealbreaker, and when my membership is up this month I'm probably gone.",

            "Definitely the best gym in the Kips Bay / Flatiron area! Has all the equipment and amenities you could want including lockers (with locks!) and towels, plenty of floor and rack space for workouts, and super helpful / responsive staff. Hours are also really great relative to other gyms and it's super easy to get in anytime using the app.",
            "I signed up using classpass but you could tell most of the people here have memberships. The y7 studio is connected too so when you check in you gotta let them know you're here for solace.\n\nI think this class is for intermediate crossfit people- I had no idea what I was doing and couldn't complete the sets that we were told at each station lol\n\nThere were multiple stations but the class I went to was overbooked so we had to switch during the cycling- it got confusing at times. There was cycling, rowing, burpees, squatting with weight, etc.\n\nYou basically rotate around the stations for 3 rounds. By the 3rd round I was dying...people were squatting with 45lbs easily (guys and girls)- I'm out here looking for 10lb but the lightest was still 15lb ..got me dying lol The space to do the workout was kinda small just fyi. Coach was pretty encouraging.\n\nIf you know what you're doing in crossfit then this the class for you- people had 6 packs etc. I had no packs...\nI gave it 4 stars bc I think if you were into crossfit this is prob a good workout. If you're a beginner this prob isn't the place- not much direction.\n\nPlace is super clean!-there are lockers and showers in the back - very spacious.",
            "Great box to drop into if you are comfortable doing your own wod. All the equipment you need. There were a fair number of people, but it never seemed crowded.\nWill visit again for sure.",
            "Awesome place to workout at! I was in New York for 3 days, and bought one week pass for $80. Equipments and whole facility is well organized and clean. Totally recommend CrossFiter or weight lifter looking for a place to do their own workout while in New York",
            "Solace offers a variety of classes - CrossFit, HIIT, body building/strength, and gymnastics, so there is something for everyone and classes start as early at 5:30 a.m and end as late as 9:00 p.m. I've only worked with two coaches and both left a lot to be desired. For a box that prides itself on the quality of coaches, I expected more attention to my form especially because I was new to CrossFit at the time. One of the coaches watched me doing something incorrectly and didn't correct me, instead another guy in my class helped me out and gave me tips.\n\nI took classes through Classpass and did the CrossFit Foundations program since they were running a free trial but didn't sign up for a membership because the cost of membership is very expensive and hard to justify based on the amenities. The cheapest membership option is $299 billed monthly as part of a 6 month commitment. At $299 I expect a state of the art, modern locker room and top notch amenities, but that is not the case. The lockers are oddly shaped and it's hard to fit all of your stuff in one locker, so you end up using two. Not only do the shower stalls need a good scrub down, they need to be renovated. The sink area doesn't have any of the essentials you'd find at an actual high end gym such as q-tips, shaving cream, face wash, razors, hair spray, etc. Amenities in the locker room are subpar at best. At $299/month I'd expect the best of the best.",
            "This is hands down one of the best gyms I've been to in NYC.\n\nO V E R A L L\nThe location is beautiful. The coaches are great. There are classes almost every hour and there are tons of amenities.\n\nIf you need to hit a quick CrossFit class here and then shower and go, they have an incredible bathroom set up (showers, changing rooms, blow driers, full-length mirrors, etc.) It's super legit\n\nTheir equipment is also top notch, clean and in great working condition. You can tell that the members also care a lot about their facility and work hard to keep everything up. Every piece of gear has a place and it's an OCD person's dream.\n\nThe coaches are wonderful. I cannot recommend them enough. GO HERE WHEN IN NYC!",
            "Hey Emily - Thank you so much for the great review. We set the bar really high for ourselves and take great pride in running a facility with top of the line classes, coaches, & equipment. We're so glad you enjoyed your experience and would love to see you back next time your NYC!\n\nKeep working hard!",
            "***Friendly staff, Encouraging instructors, Intense***\n\nI took one of the sculpt classes in the side room on the first floor. The instructor was really supportive and took the time to make corrections. Their water refill is in the basement level, which was a bit annoying. Also, their side studio AC wasn't very strong. Overall, it was a good workout but I probably wouldn't take that class again.",
            "Thanks Liz! Glad you enjoyed class and appreciate your feedback.",
            "The specialized \"cycles\" are really what sets this gym apart. You get own bespoke weight and rep schemes for an 8 week (in the case of strength cycle) period. Even though it's a small class, you get incredibly specific feedback on form. No ugly lifts allowed. Period. It's just like having a personal trainer, but Hayden and his team are better than any personal trainer you'll find. Every single class feeds off the work in the previous class. What you lift Friday is based on your performance on Monday and Wednesday, all individually tailed from your coach. (As opposed to say an oly wod where you snatch one day and front squat the next, and tracking and weight/rep adjustment is mostly on you). If you want to get measurably stronger with professionals guiding you *specifically* every step of the way with constant personalized feedback, this is the quickest way to do it.\n\nThe coaches are incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and each very personally accomplished in fitness. (Shoutout to Danielle and Ryan -- thanks so much!)",
            "I used to be a loyal member here for TWO years and used to rave about Solace New York. I have brought countless drop ins and have convinced many of my friends to join since I loved the community (it used to have).\n\nWhen the founders of the gym initially started this box, there was a huge emphasis on community and there was actual customer service. Since their new management took over, there's been a huge lack thereof customer service, amenities, and professionalism. One weekend I left town and their app wasn't working so I had no way of cancelling or opting out of classes and was hit with a late fee. I e-mailed to see if I could get refunded for this and they made it a bigger deal than it had to be. You would think that they would be slightly accommodating to a loyal customer of 2 years who's spent over $6,888 in membership fees but nope! For me this was the breaking point of why I wanted to put my membership on hold until I found a new studio that piqued my interest. (I've also had multiple items stolen in their facilities. When notifying their staff of this, I was told that they couldn't do anything unless I kept it in a paid locked locker. Note: I did and PAID over $30/month for it and go figure, NOTHING happened).\n\nBefore I paused my membership, I dropped into a new box, Neo Fifth, that's not too far from there and was immediately given the e-mail below (see attached. Not only that, but I was given snarky remarks by one of the trainers there about what's better and what's not. To be completely honest, I understood the trainer's frustration because gyms in NY are very competitive; however, I am a consumer coming whose profession is a consumer focused industry and his behavior was completely unprofessional. Do you think Equinox trash talks Crunch or Planet Fitness on status quo? No... If you're the best, your work will speak for itself.\n\nWhile I was a member here, I did enjoy the culture and programming at Solace but what was disappointing is their customer service.

Even though it's a small class, you get incredibly specific feedback on form. No ugly lifts allowed. Period. It's just like having a personal trainer, but Hayden and his team are better than any personal trainer you'll find. Every single class feeds off the work in the previous class. What you lift Friday is based on your performance on Monday and Wednesday, all individually tailed from your coach. (As opposed to say an oly wod where you snatch one day and front squat the next, and tracking and weight/rep adjustment is mostly on you). If you want to get measurably stronger with professionals guiding you *specifically* every step of the way with constant personalized feedback, this is the quickest way to do it.\n\nThe coaches are incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and each very personally accomplished in fitness.

For me this was the breaking point of why I wanted to put my membership on hold until I found a new studio that piqued my interest. (I've also had multiple items stolen in their facilities. When notifying their staff of this, I was told that they couldn't do anything unless I kept it in a paid locked locker. Note: I did and PAID over $30/month for it and go figure, NOTHING happened).\n\nBefore I paused my membership, I dropped into a new box, Neo Fifth, that's not too far from there and was given snarky remarks by one of the trainers there about what's better and what's not. I was immediately given the e-mail below (see attached).\n\n\"Kim,\n\nI am sorry to learn you're unsatisfied with your service at Solace. Customer service is the single most important pillar to our business and we work hard to do right by all of our members. In the best interested of both parties we have terminated your membership effective immediately. We are willing to discuss options at a later date if you wish to resume with us.\n\nBest,\nHannah\"\n\n\nTo be completely honest, I understood the trainer's frustration because gyms in NY are very competitive; however, I am a consumer who pays to go to your gym - don't tell me how to spend my money. I'm a consumer coming whose profession is in a consumer focused industry; his behavior was completely unprofessional. Do you think Equinox trash talks Crunch or Planet Fitness on status quo? No... If you're the best, your work will speak for itself.\n\nWhile I was a member here, I did enjoy the culture and programming at Solace but what was disappointing is their customer service. To know that a \"customer service representative\" of theirs could care less about a member who's been there for 2 years out of the 3 years it's been opened says a lot about their management and professionalism. Even when I tried contacting their GM, Bryan, about the level of unprofessionalism I experienced, he forwarded my email to his wife and their \"customer service\" member, Hannah, who evidently doesn't care about retention rates. The retention of their coaches is a but off-putting too since half of the original and experienced coaches that started there are no longer there (disheartening really).\n\nPros:\n- The people that go there are sweet, they're kind, and are motivating. The people I've met the last two years are some of my very good friends.\n- Crossfit programming\n- Olympic Weightlifting Cycle\n\nIt's their management that's not up to par.

            "Definitely the best gym in the Kips Bay / Flatiron area! Has all the equipment and amenities you could want including lockers (with locks!) and towels, plenty of floor and rack space for workouts, and super helpful / responsive staff. Hours are also really great relative to other gyms and it's super easy to get in anytime using the app.",
            "I signed up using classpass but you could tell most of the people here have memberships. The y7 studio is connected too so when you check in you gotta let them know you're here for solace.\n\nI think this class is for intermediate crossfit people- I had no idea what I was doing and couldn't complete the sets that we were told at each station lol\n\nThere were multiple stations but the class I went to was overbooked so we had to switch during the cycling- it got confusing at times. There was cycling, rowing, burpees, squatting with weight, etc.\n\nYou basically rotate around the stations for 3 rounds. By the 3rd round I was dying...people were squatting with 45lbs easily (guys and girls)- I'm out here looking for 10lb but the lightest was still 15lb ..got me dying lol The space to do the workout was kinda small just fyi. Coach was pretty encouraging.\n\nIf you know what you're doing in crossfit then this the class for you- people had 6 packs etc. I had no packs...\nI gave it 4 stars bc I think if you were into crossfit this is prob a good workout. If you're a beginner this prob isn't the place- not much direction.\n\nPlace is super clean!-there are lockers and showers in the back - very spacious.",
            "Great box to drop into if you are comfortable doing your own wod. All the equipment you need. There were a fair number of people, but it never seemed crowded.\nWill visit again for sure.",
            "Awesome place to workout at! I was in New York for 3 days, and bought one week pass for $80. Equipments and whole facility is well organized and clean. Totally recommend CrossFiter or weight lifter looking for a place to do their own workout while in New York",
            "Solace offers a variety of classes - CrossFit, HIIT, body building/strength, and gymnastics, so there is something for everyone and classes start as early at 5:30 a.m and end as late as 9:00 p.m. I've only worked with two coaches and both left a lot to be desired. For a box that prides itself on the quality of coaches, I expected more attention to my form especially because I was new to CrossFit at the time. One of the coaches watched me doing something incorrectly and didn't correct me, instead another guy in my class helped me out and gave me tips.\n\nI took classes through Classpass and did the CrossFit Foundations program since they were running a free trial but didn't sign up for a membership because the cost of membership is very expensive and hard to justify based on the amenities. The cheapest membership option is $299 billed monthly as part of a 6 month commitment. At $299 I expect a state of the art, modern locker room and top notch amenities, but that is not the case. The lockers are oddly shaped and it's hard to fit all of your stuff in one locker, so you end up using two. Not only do the shower stalls need a good scrub down, they need to be renovated. The sink area doesn't have any of the essentials you'd find at an actual high end gym such as q-tips, shaving cream, face wash, razors, hair spray, etc. Amenities in the locker room are subpar at best. At $299/month I'd expect the best of the best.",
            "This is hands down one of the best gyms I've been to in NYC.\n\nO V E R A L L\nThe location is beautiful. The coaches are great. There are classes almost every hour and there are tons of amenities.\n\nIf you need to hit a quick CrossFit class here and then shower and go, they have an incredible bathroom set up (showers, changing rooms, blow driers, full-length mirrors, etc.) It's super legit\n\nTheir equipment is also top notch, clean and in great working condition. You can tell that the members also care a lot about their facility and work hard to keep everything up. Every piece of gear has a place and it's an OCD person's dream.\n\nThe coaches are wonderful. I cannot recommend them enough. GO HERE WHEN IN NYC!",
            "Hey Emily - Thank you so much for the great review. We set the bar really high for ourselves and take great pride in running a facility with top of the line classes, coaches, & equipment. We're so glad you enjoyed your experience and would love to see you back next time your NYC!\n\nKeep working hard!",
            "***Friendly staff, Encouraging instructors, Intense***\n\nI took one of the sculpt classes in the side room on the first floor. The instructor was really supportive and took the time to make corrections. Their water refill is in the basement level, which was a bit annoying. Also, their side studio AC wasn't very strong. Overall, it was a good workout but I probably wouldn't take that class again.",
            "Thanks Liz! Glad you enjoyed class and appreciate your feedback.",
            "The specialized \"cycles\" are really what sets this gym apart. You get own bespoke weight and rep schemes for an 8 week (in the case of strength cycle) period. Even though it's a small class, you get incredibly specific feedback on form. No ugly lifts allowed. Period. It's just like having a personal trainer, but Hayden and his team are better than any personal trainer you'll find. Every single class feeds off the work in the previous class. What you lift Friday is based on your performance on Monday and Wednesday, all individually tailed from your coach. (As opposed to say an oly wod where you snatch one day and front squat the next, and tracking and weight/rep adjustment is mostly on you). If you want to get measurably stronger with professionals guiding you *specifically* every step of the way with constant personalized feedback, this is the quickest way to do it.\n\nThe coaches are incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and each very personally accomplished in fitness.

            "Start your review of Blink Fitness - Murray Hill",
            "My goal is to visit as many Blink gyms in NYC.\n\nLocation: downstairs, very down. a lot of steps down\nElevator: yes\nConvenience: in murray hill technically but grand central 4/5/6 seems closest station.\nGym Size: large size basement gym. \":Fat I\" shaped layout. Large stretch area. Large free weight area.\nLocker Room Size (Men's): small to average for the size of gym. Note ample showers and toilets, more than other Blinks.\nEquipment (outside of the basics mentioned below): battle ropes, many plyo boxes, ski erg, sandbags, Elevate Row and Core machines. No kettlebells above 50 lbs\nCrowdedness: Target audience seems to be residents under 30 yrs old. I was told it gets busy M-F after 6pm and weekends are manageable.\nCleanliness: clean enough.\nStaff Friendliness: Average. However, there was one worker blasting music on his cellphone loudly.\nHours: 7 days/wk. On par with other NYC Blinks.\nOverall: one of the better Blinks in terms of equipment and size. Large stretch area. Had equipment at this Blink rarely seen at other Blinks including a Ski Erg, Elevate Row and Core, other bikes. Locker room size is a tad small but manageable. Large free weight and bench area but busy.\n\n*Unless noted, assume all Blink gyms have locker rooms, water fountain, stretch area, dumbbells, kettlebells (up to 50lbs), smith machines, weight machines, cardio equipment (Rower, treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, stairclimber), showers, wipes, Towel machine (pay separate charge). Assume you can scan in via App or Apple Wallet/Watch\n**Note: I am a Blink user with entry possibility of all their NYC area gyms via an Add-on to my Classpass membership. (I did not want to deal with Blink corporate in case I needed to cancel and wanted to avoid a startup fee or annual charge). I do not take showers at the gym and tend to go off-peak hours.",
            "It's just too crowded. Too many people. Every single time I go.\n\nIt's so demoralising to get ready and go workout and you can barely do half your routine.\n\nThe equipment is ok there's just not enough of it given the number of memberships they've given out.\n\nI'm going to leave soon.",
            "Despite signing up for a grey membership and I cancelled one week after, I had to pay total 3month and also \"register fee\" which they didn't tell me at first.\n\nLack of clarity in their membership policy, soooooooo many hidden fees and incredibly frustrating experience.",
            "I will give them 0 if I could... Don't loose your money here. The weight area is ALWAYS crowded, doesn't matter the hour, it's always crowded. So, when you try to cancel the membership, they don't process the cancellation on the system and they will keep charging you. Even thought, after the cancellation day is effective.\n\nI cancelled my membership on 9/22/2023 and they didn't submit the information on the system (luckily I took a screenshot). Following their own cancellation policy, the effective day of the membership cancellation must be 11/7/2023. Well, they didn't submit the information and I got charge for December. The manager Demetrious doesn't answer calls and after 1 month and a half I was able to contact customer services from Corporate and get the outstanding balance removed.

            "I went to this gym for about a year. Great enviornment and has all the equipment you would need for a good workout! My only issues I ran into in this gym was the temperature and the closeness of some of the equipment. Kind of gym that feels muggy no matter what the weather is. Can be incredibly hot and humid at some times especially around the cardio machines. Not a big issue but for the cost of the membership this was one thing that always bothered me. Another thing I noticed was how close some of the machines are to one another. When you get your trainer certification (which I have) you learn that equipment placed too close together can be dangerous. There is a bench located right next to the warmup floor area, and if someone benching had to bail, their barbell could fall into the people stretching and hurt someone. The seated hamstring curl is also located very close to the shoulder machine next to it and you can't really use it if someone's on one of them.\nI still really enjoyed my time at this gym the staff is super chill and nice and it's kept clean!

            "I went to this gym for about a year. Great enviornment and has all the equipment you would need for a good workout! My only issues I ran into in this gym was the temperature and the closeness of some of the equipment. Kind of gym that feels muggy no matter what the weather is. Can be incredibly hot and humid at some times especially around the cardio machines. Not a big issue but for the cost of the membership this was one thing that always bothered me. Another thing I noticed was how close some of the machines are to one another. When you get your trainer certification (which I have) you learn that equipment placed too close together can be dangerous. There is a bench located right next to the warmup floor area, and if someone benching had to bail, their barbell could fall into the people stretching and hurt someone. The seated hamstring curl is also located very close to the shoulder machine next to it and you can't really use it if someone's on one of them.\nI still really enjoyed my time at this gym the staff is super chill and nice and it's kept clean!

            "I took a couple of classes hear and had a great time! The instructors has easier breakdowns if a certain move is too difficult, and won't push u if you are feeling too scared to do certain things but will inform you that it's not that you can't do certain obstacles, it's your brains safety mode being on, which helps me to try to get past that. Have had a really good workout and learned a couple of techniques I feel will help me run away from danger if ever in need:)\n\nAlso the place looks really cool and colorful they have many types of classes you can take, parcour, free running, bars, aerial yoga etc. Always so cool seeing people do their own thing and perfect their art",
            "Good folks\n\nChris is great instructor\n\nLots for kids to do on two huge floors. We dud camp first the day",
            "We brought my bf's ten year old here for the summer camp and HE LOVES IT! He is so excited to go every day and comes home happy and tired. It is really helping him with motor skills and getting him to be braver and more confident. Super happy we found this place.",
            "Really cool recreational gym with a lot of different classes to choose from. I typically do the flip class with Sha, who is super friendly, talkative, and makes you feel safe. He never pushes too much, but just enough to help you conquer your fears! I have also done the handstands and bars class, as well as spent some time doing random stuff like trampoline during open gym hours. Overall great place with a nice vibe, has a lot of friendly people who frequent this parkour gym. I would recommend this for someone who is trying to be more active and push the limits of their body!",
            "So if you think this is a zoo just like I did, it isn't! I came here for a birthday party thinking I was going to see and pet little cute animals but boy was I wrong.\n\nThis place is a massive warehouse like (and funky) gym/ninja warrior style venue, perfect to burn your kids's energy levels. We came here for a birthday party not knowing what to expect (should've googled beforehand but did not) and we ended up having so much fun.\n\nThe building has two floors with different activities. There were approx. 40 kids in our party so we were split into two different groups. The staff were all nice, friendly and helpful. All the kids had an absolute ball.\n\nFood and drinks were served upstairs on their third floor. Very spacious floor for kids to run around with great views of surrounding buildings too. There is a rooftop but we didn't check it out as it was too cold. The building has both stairs and elevators - easy for strollers.\n\nThe commute from Manhattan wasn't so bad either. Got the L line and it is less than a 10 mins walk to get there from the subway station.",
            "Cool facility, good classes, lots of fun. The people who work there are pleasant. Only downside is it's kind of pricy \u200d",
            "Signed up for a day. There were several instructors for a small group. They learned all the kids' names. They were attentive and kind. They offered spots wherever needed.

The instructors has easier breakdowns if a certain move is too difficult, and won't push u if you are feeling too scared to do certain things but will inform you that it's not that you can't do certain obstacles, it's your brains safety mode being on, which helps me to try to get past that.

            "Small but clean studio located in the city. Had a 20-minute phone consultation with Westley on pricing, assessments, and fitness goals. The transaction went smoothly and then he had me fill out a 2-part questionnaire and then sign my name. The assessment was $99 including a 1-minute tour of the studio, 40min talk therapy, 2 mins body scale/measurements, then a 10mins mini workout on an air bike, planks, squats, and stretching. My trainer was Brian, and he was great to work with but I felt some of the questions he was asking me about my goals were a repeat of what I have already filled out in the questionnaire. There were some questions that was slightly different but they seemed redundant. If I knew the assessment involved 40-minutes talk therapy I wouldn't have signed up! I have never heard of a place where they charge you for a trial. But I have also checked out other studio places where they don't even offer any trials and expect you to buy their package and pay upfront. No thanks.\n\nOn a final note, even though it was a 10min mini workout, I actually left feeling sore (for sure!) for three days. So I give it 4 stars for a pretty good workout (or the soreness came from being out of shape for so long and leading a sedentary lifestyle) I would not have gotten if I went to a gym and did cardio. This place is expensive. Like two arms and a half a leg with some toes. Sadly this place wasn't for me, location and cost but maybe it is for you!\n\nIf you want to workout with a trainer and get some eye candy, there is that too! lol",

            "I truly love this gym. I joined back in July and have truly enjoyed every minute. Each coach has their own style but they are all very knowledgeable and care about your continual improvement and form. The coaches create workout plans for you and follow up with you to see how you're progressing etc. additionally, they offer strategy calls where you can discuss your goals and how to achieve them. This gym is a little family - you start getting to know your classmates and the coaches and connect with them on a different level. The other members are incredibly supportive and encouraging. I cannot say how many times I was ready to give up on a set and I hear someone yell out that I got this and am doing great. That support is hard to come by. Also, the owners and staff strive to make it feel like a community - they get to know the members and create opportunities for members to get together and spend time with one another. We just had a holiday party which was super fun. They even gave out awards! It was an incredibly awesome way to round out the year. A lot of people have been going to this gym for years - which speaks volumes. I highly highly recommend UpFit. Come give it a shot, guaranteed you won't regret it!",

Very socially distanced with only 5 members in the gym at once. The equipment is sanitized after each use and temperature checks upon entering.",

All the trainers know your name and truly care about your well being. The exercises are intentional and the coaches try their best to help you meet your goals. Their nutritional advice was also extremely helpful when it came to figuring out a healthy lifestyle. I just tried kickboxing with Wes for the first time today and it was fantastic and most importantly so fun. UpFit is the most unique small training gym that I've ever been to. Hurting from other group classes or tired of running on the treadmill? Look no further. It's always so impressive to get so much out of a focused one hour class instead of jogging for hours in the past. Health truly is wealth and I wish more people will learn that fitness is not just for weight loss or body image. It's about preventing pain and working weak muscles that we rarely strengthen in our day to day lives. UpFit cares about form and preventing pain. I cannot recommend this facility enough.",

            "Scam alert!\n\nI wish I read these reviews prior to signing up for the 6 week challenge. I was motivated and hopeful, especially due to prior positive crossfit experiences at other gyms and learned a big lesson about reading reviews first.\n\nTo be clear:\nThe 6 week challenge which is falsely advertised as free costs $632. If you lose 25 pounds they say you get your money back. Doing the math, this type of program endorses disordered exercise and eating. It's not healthy to lose that amount of weight in 6 weeks They exploit those that have unrealistic goals, financially.\n\nPersonally, I am writing because I was supposed to start the 6 week challenge right before COVID and they continued to bill be throughout the gym closures. I explained that I would be willing to transfer the money I already paid into a regular membership following COVID and they refused. I called my credit card company since it is illegal to charge for a gym that is closed due to COVID. The credit card company advised to file a claim. They responded by calling collections. I am confident that the credit card company will handle this for me, but am sickened by these practices overall. Mostly, I am genuinely worried about the mental health of potential consumers in the future.\n\nThe actual classes are extremely variable since the staff are not well trained. The staff themselves told\nme that they are not treated properly and that there are is little, inconsistent communication with management. It shows in the classes, and the workouts are not as effective as other crossfit programs I have done as a result.",
            "I have mixed feelings about this. The staff is great, classes are good, great accountability coaches and awesome community.\n\nHowever, management is awful. They are scammers. Joe ( who refused to provide his last name and direct number) is the most horrible and greedy person I ever encounter. I take he is one of the owners.\n\nAfter the pandemic broke, I reached out to one of the coaches and asked for my membership to be cancelled, the reason being: no longer living in the city and financial hardships. I got an \"ok\" text message.\n\nMonths later, I get a charge on my credit card. I was connected to Joe, who wanted to charge me for another month as a cancelation fee, which clearly is not part of the contract, and refused to give me credit for the month charged.\n\nAfter many back and forth emails, he finally understood and agreed a proper notice was given and no extra charges were to be charged to my account. I have on an email with his own words agreeing to this.\n\nThey stole my money, he is a thief. I had to call my credit company to dispute the charge. They settled to give me a refund, which I was happy. But later, they send me to collections???? For something he agreed and settled?? Talk about ethics.\n\nStay away from this gym, there are far better gyms with better customer service and honesty than WillyB. They are scammers, and as much as I hate to say this: they deserve to close for their terrible customer service ethics.",
            "I participated in Bowery Crossfit's Crossfit classes in summer 2018, when they were doing their Summer of Strength programming that involved more regular strength components (squat, deadlift, OHP). The coaches (I mainly had Kai, Jeff, and Ryan M.) are really friendly and encouraging. They push each person appropriately. They and my classmates made me feel good about my strengths and motivated to work hard on my weaknesses. I'm terrible at Assault bike WODs but never felt bad about finishing last as everyone cheered me on. Kai plays the perfect music for Crossfit in my opinion. It helps me push and keep going when I would usually just rest for a bit.\n\nI do think sometimes coaches let students get away with bad form during Olympic lifts (not catching low enough which can slow down progress, or catching with the back at an angle that looks dangerous to me) so wouldn't recommend pushing yourself too hard on those here. I am not a coach, but my first Crossfit box had an Olympic weightlifting-specific coach who competes at the national level, and my opinion on form comes from taking classes with him. This isn't an Olympic lifting gym, obviously, so I wouldn't dock Bowery stars for not being focused on Olympic lifting. I think Crossfit and specifically Bowery Crossfit do a great job of easing people into lifting and teaching the basics safely. I don't think you would get injured as a beginner or intermediate-level athlete here. Like, I wouldn't worry unless you're cleaning 1xbw as a woman or 1.5xbw as a man and trying to clean more.\n\nI switched to their open gym level of membership when the school year started as the Crossfit class times didn't work well with my course schedule and I also didn't fancy the return to more typical Crossfit programming without regular strength training. They have a good selection of equipment, and you can pay a bit extra for key card access to the gym outside of normal business hours. Their open gym hours are never crowded, so I've always had space for everything I've wanted to do. I dislike waiting for the squat rack at my university gym, so the open gym level of membership was well worth it for me. Ryan O. keeps everything well maintained and handled all my membership transitions and replied to my various emails smoothly and promptly.\n\nI'm now trying out another gym that's focused on powerlifting. My resting heart rate went from around 60 bpm to around 53 bpm while I was doing Bowery's Crossfit classes, and now it's back at around 60 bpm, lol. Bowery is great for conditioning and learning the basics of strength training, as it's a lovely, inclusive environment with cool people. If you're new in town, you could make friends easily here, as there are social events once in a while, and people often take the same class time. If you care about Oly enough that this review turns you off, but not enough to go to an Oly-exclusive gym, try Crossfit NYC Flatiron. Bowery is great for drop-ins as I think it's only $30, which is on the cheaper side for a Crossfit drop-in, and they're very responsive to email if you need help setting it up logistically.",
            "I took the 6 Week Challenge and loved my experience at both the Willy B Bowery and Tribeca locations. The trainers, the equipment, the results- everything was excellent\n\nThe trainers are very knowledgeable. I had never done CrossFit before and, while I had done weight training, rowing and kettlebell classes elsewhere, I was able to learn and grow as an athlete. If there were movements that were too advanced for my skillset, the trainers were able to help modify some of the more advanced movements so that over time I could achieve the advanced movement safely and correctly.\n\nThe gym itself is fantastic. They just gave the Tribeca space a complete makeover and its great atmosphere to workout in. All the equipment is well maintained and cleaned regularly. Its a very safe and amazing space to workout.\n\nAnd thanks to the previous two things, I got some amazing results with which I am incredibly pleased. I lost 6% body fat which initially I thought was going to be pretty darn impossible to accomplish. But, with the help of my trainers in class and the diet plan that they gave me, I was able to crush my goals. My clothes are loose. I can see my abdominal muscles for the first time ever. Plus I have received quite a bit of notice from coworkers about my slimmer and trimmer build. It's been a major win\n\nThis program was so worth it. If you are looking to up your fitness goals, give Willy B CrossFit Bowery or Tribeca a try.",
            "Just finished a very challenging 6-week challenge at Willyb.fit.\nIt was intense and informative. I pushed myself to the limits thanks to Chris and all the trainers who motivated from day 1. I learned more about nutrition and adjusted to reach my goal. I am grateful and glad I took that challenge. I would recommend this program to anyone looking for real results in their daily workout routine!\nGo WillyB go!!",
            "I came in to WillyB Crossfit to take their 6 week challenge and didn't really know what to expect. It turned out to an awesome experience. I lost 6 percent of my body fat in just 3 weeks\nI took all my HIIT classes with Chris, he makes the classes fun and at the same time pushes you to do your best. Jeff was the person I took most of my crossfit classes and I am amazed of knowledgable he is in just about everything. He teaches you proper techniques so you won't get hurt and shows steps on how you can gradually work towards doing all exercises to the fullest.\nThe workout are tough but so much fun. I learned to do things I never would have attempted to do on my own going to the gym. The atmosphere is great and even the other member are friendly and supportive during class. They also have a few other locations in Brooklyn.",
            "Review of 6 week challenge:\n\n\n\nWanting to make some changes and meet some personal fitness goals I took to searching for a program to help motivate me further. Thankfully I found Bowery Crossfit on Instagram where they were promoting their periodic 6 week challenge.\n\nCaught between an impending trip abroad and a strong desire to get closer to my goals, I decided to make both happen. The team worked with me to schedule around my 2 week trip and with great effort on my part and considerable understanding on theirs, we made it happen.\n\nThe gym set one of two goals to beat for the challenge: either hit 25 pounds or 6% body fat in 6 weeks. The program was 600 dollars for the duration of the challenge split however is comfortable. I did it in 2 payments of 300. You can also pay as you go. There are a couple of weigh ins to monitor your growth. Upon final weigh in if you beat the challenge you have the option of a refund (check, refund to debit or credit card, or pay it towards a (slightly discounted?) Gym membership which you can structure with the staff accordingly.\n\nTo reach that goal they reccomend hitting the gym at least 3 times a week, though students could attend as many crossfit and HIIT classes as often as they wanted, provided they participate in 8 Crossfit Fundamentals training classes, before moving up to regular Crossfit classes. This can also be accomplished by taking HIIT sessions in combination.\n\nI found that the most effective strategy was to follow up my Crossfit Fundamentals class with a HIIT class, 1 hour each, led by a personal coach guiding the class. Depending on how many people signed up for the session, you could even have a 1 on 1 personal training session with the coach if you were the only one who came. Even for larger groups, you still get more individual attention.\n\nIt seems crazy but you can do it and much more if you try. Coach Mark gave me some excellent words of courage \"its okay to throw up but you can't give up\"; words to live by. One of the best coaches they have, he'll help push you to your limit, especially in the HIIT class, and he was very welcoming, the main reason I ended up taking the HIIT classes because he invited us to after the crossfit Fundamentals, which I didnt know we could do as students until he kindly encouraged us to if we wanted more of a challenge.\n\nI met with Abbee initially who handled my intake, where we spoke about time line , goals , process, and after signing the papers she handed my initial weigh in, so that we could track growth toward the 6 week challenge goal.\n\nAfter that I was set up with Chris as my accountability coach, who recommended that I use the myfitnesspal app to track my caloric intake and nutrition plan. All the main staff use in house texting numbers so you can reach out to ask questions and be pushy about it if you have to--pushy meaning persistent but respectful.\n\nThere are several coaches. Amanda is rarely at the Bowery location but she is easily the best agility and movement instructor (think yoga and similar). I got to work with her only once but it was so enjoyable. Mark is a work master he'll push you hard and motivate you and he's a champ. The other coaches are also very good. I worked with Kai and Jeff and Maria as well. All extremely well trained and knowledgeable.\n\nThey also are great about scaling the movements and the repetitions based on your current strength level, so you can do the workouts adjusted to your level.\n\nAsk ask and keep asking. Be proactive about it. The more you ask the more you interact with the coaches the more you'll get out of it. If you dont understand a process or a movement or parts of your nutritional plan ask and challenge and question. They can teach you good things and by questioning and doing your own research you can augment the process so you reach your goal faster and more efficiently.\n\nNot only did I hit the 25 pound weight loss goals I lost closer to 30 pounds, and if that wasnt enough I also broke 6% , closer to 7%. You can do it too! Just actually try.\n\nThe beauty of crossfit is functional fitness and that if you stick with it and ask questions and do it regularly you will learn the movements and will learn to recreate them and reproduce them at will, learning from some of the best trained coaches.\n\nOverall was an excellent experience. Would recommend it to others. Crossfit training is probably the best. A membership at Bowery crossfit gives you access to multiple locationa. I was always at 285 Grand Street location in the Bowery area of Manhattan.\n\nI liked it there, people were friendly, staff were nice. It was a great program and an excellent choice to do the challenge. And I beat the challenge too :) .",
            "Having traveled around the country and visited dozens and dozens of CrossFit Gyms, it's always nice when you find a incredibly welcoming gym, with great equipment, and an even better coach. But even more surprising that it's in New York City. Kai was one of the best coaches I've experienced in over 10 years of CrossFit.",
            "I had the opportunity to drop in to Bowery Crossfit and get a great workout. The space is in the basement of a building in the heart of Chinatown. The size is relatively big (especially for New York) and they have the majority of items you need for a great workout. As a taller guy (6'6\") the ceilings and heights of the pull up bars were slightly low, but not enough to hamper a workout that included pull-ups or box jumps.\n\nMy coach was Isabel and she was both friendly and helpful. She also is a rock star, going to Regionals in Europe! The workout was well constructed and enjoyable.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to either a local or a visiting member.\n\nThanks Bowery for having me!",
            "I highly recommend WillyB Crossfit! If you are looking to challenge yourself, to be/stay healthy and to be part of a community that motivates each other to do well, this is the right gym for you!\n\nI joined WillyB Crossfit and did the 6-week challenge. My goal was to lose 6% body fat, which seemed impossible at the time of the orientation. But I made it, thanks to all the awesome people I've met in this gym!\n\nI had a very helpful and encouraging fitness/nutrition coach, Chris. If you do the challenge, they will assign you a coach that will guide you through the whole journey.\n\nAlong with that, the fitness coaches I've met through the Foundations, Crossfit and HIIT classes who I'm so grateful for. They make sure you are doing the work out safely and with the right form, but also that you are pushing and challenging yourself.\n\nThe athletes/students who work out in the gym are also very friendly, and there is a sense of community that you just want to keep coming back and get stronger with everybody.\n\nI love this gym and I would give more than 5 stars if I could!",
            "Scam alert!\n\nI wish I read these reviews prior to signing up for the 6 week challenge. I was motivated and hopeful, especially due to prior positive crossfit experiences at other gyms and learned a big lesson about reading reviews first.\n\nTo be clear:\nThe 6 week challenge which is falsely advertised as free costs $632. If you lose 25 pounds they say you get your money back. Doing the math, this type of program endorses disordered exercise and eating. It's not healthy to lose that amount of weight in 6 weeks They exploit those that have unrealistic goals, financially.\n\nPersonally, I am writing because I was supposed to start the 6 week challenge right before COVID and they continued to bill be throughout the gym closures. I explained that I would be willing to transfer the money I already paid into a regular membership following COVID and they refused. I called my credit card company since it is illegal to charge for a gym that is closed due to COVID. The credit card company advised to file a claim. They responded by calling collections. I am confident that the credit card company will handle this for me, but am sickened by these practices overall. Mostly, I am genuinely worried about the mental health of potential consumers in the future.\n\nThe actual classes are extremely variable since the staff are not well trained. The staff themselves told\nme that they are not treated properly and that there are is little, inconsistent communication with management. It shows in the classes, and the workouts are not as effective as other crossfit programs I have done as a result.",
            "I have mixed feelings about this. The staff is great, classes are good, great accountability coaches and awesome community.\n\nHowever, management is awful. They are scammers. Joe ( who refused to provide his last name and direct number) is the most horrible and greedy person I ever encounter. I take he is one of the owners.\n\nAfter the pandemic broke, I reached out to one of the coaches and asked for my membership to be cancelled, the reason being: no longer living in the city and financial hardships. I got an \"ok\" text message.\n\nMonths later, I get a charge on my credit card. I was connected to Joe, who wanted to charge me for another month as a cancelation fee, which clearly is not part of the contract, and refused to give me credit for the month charged.\n\nAfter many back and forth emails, he finally understood and agreed a proper notice was given and no extra charges were to be charged to my account. I have on an email with his own words agreeing to this.\n\nThey stole my money, he is a thief. I had to call my credit company to dispute the charge. They settled to give me a refund, which I was happy. But later, they send me to collections???? For something he agreed and settled?? Talk about ethics.\n\nStay away from this gym, there are far better gyms with better customer service and honesty than WillyB. They are scammers, and as much as I hate to say this: they deserve to close for their terrible customer service ethics.",
            "I participated in Bowery Crossfit's Crossfit classes in summer 2018, when they were doing their Summer of Strength programming that involved more regular strength components (squat, deadlift, OHP). The coaches (I mainly had Kai, Jeff, and Ryan M.) are really friendly and encouraging. They push each person appropriately. They and my classmates made me feel good about my strengths and motivated to work hard on my weaknesses. I'm terrible at Assault bike WODs but never felt bad about finishing last as everyone cheered me on. Kai plays the perfect music for Crossfit in my opinion. It helps me push and keep going when I would usually just rest for a bit.\n\nI do think sometimes coaches let students get away with bad form during Olympic lifts (not catching low enough which can slow down progress, or catching with the back at an angle that looks dangerous to me) so wouldn't recommend pushing yourself too hard on those here. I am not a coach, but my first Crossfit box had an Olympic weightlifting-specific coach who competes at the national level, and my opinion on form comes from taking classes with him. This isn't an Olympic lifting gym, obviously, so I wouldn't dock Bowery stars for not being focused on Olympic lifting. I think Crossfit and specifically Bowery Crossfit do a great job of easing people into lifting and teaching the basics safely. I don't think you would get injured as a beginner or intermediate-level athlete here. Like, I wouldn't worry unless you're cleaning 1xbw as a woman or 1.5xbw as a man and trying to clean more.\n\nI switched to their open gym level of membership when the school year started as the Crossfit class times didn't work well with my course schedule and I also didn't fancy the return to more typical Crossfit programming without regular strength training. They have a good selection of equipment, and you can pay a bit extra for key card access to the gym outside of normal business hours. Their open gym hours are never crowded, so I've always had space for everything I've wanted to do. I dislike waiting for the squat rack at my university gym, so the open gym level of membership was well worth it for me. Ryan O. keeps everything well maintained and handled all my membership transitions and replied to my various emails smoothly and promptly.\n\nI'm now trying out another gym that's focused on powerlifting. My resting heart rate went from around 60 bpm to around 53 bpm while I was doing Bowery's Crossfit classes, and now it's back at around 60 bpm, lol. Bowery is great for conditioning and learning the basics of strength training, as it's a lovely, inclusive environment with cool people. If you're new in town, you could make friends easily here, as there are social events once in a while, and people often take the same class time. If you care about Oly enough that this review turns you off, but not enough to go to an Oly-exclusive gym, try Crossfit NYC Flatiron. Bowery is great for drop-ins as I think it's only $30, which is on the cheaper side for a Crossfit drop-in, and they're very responsive to email if you need help setting it up logistically.",
            "I took the 6 Week Challenge and loved my experience at both the Willy B Bowery and Tribeca locations. The trainers, the equipment, the results- everything was excellent\n\nThe trainers are very knowledgeable. I had never done CrossFit before and, while I had done weight training, rowing and kettlebell classes elsewhere, I was able to learn and grow as an athlete. If there were movements that were too advanced for my skillset, the trainers were able to help modify some of the more advanced movements so that over time I could achieve the advanced movement safely and correctly.\n\nThe gym itself is fantastic. They just gave the Tribeca space a complete makeover and its great atmosphere to workout in. All the equipment is well maintained and cleaned regularly. Its a very safe and amazing space to workout.\n\nAnd thanks to the previous two things, I got some amazing results with which I am incredibly pleased. I lost 6% body fat which initially I thought was going to be pretty darn impossible to accomplish. But, with the help of my trainers in class and the diet plan that they gave me, I was able to crush my goals. My clothes are loose. I can see my abdominal muscles for the first time ever. Plus I have received quite a bit of notice from coworkers about my slimmer and trimmer build. It's been a major win\n\nThis program was so worth it. If you are looking to up your fitness goals, give Willy B CrossFit Bowery or Tribeca a try.",
            "Just finished a very challenging 6-week challenge at Willyb.fit.\nIt was intense and informative. I pushed myself to the limits thanks to Chris and all the trainers who motivated from day 1. I learned more about nutrition and adjusted to reach my goal. I am grateful and glad I took that challenge. I would recommend this program to anyone looking for real results in their daily workout routine!\nGo WillyB go!!",
            "I came in to WillyB Crossfit to take their 6 week challenge and didn't really know what to expect. It turned out to an awesome experience. I lost 6 percent of my body fat in just 3 weeks\nI took all my HIIT classes with Chris, he makes the classes fun and at the same time pushes you to do your best. Jeff was the person I took most of my crossfit classes and I am amazed of knowledgable he is in just about everything. He teaches you proper techniques so you won't get hurt and shows steps on how you can gradually work towards doing all exercises to the fullest.\nThe workout are tough but so much fun. I learned to do things I never would have attempted to do on my own going to the gym. The atmosphere is great and even the other member are friendly and supportive during class. They also have a few other locations in Brooklyn.",
            "Review of 6 week challenge:\n\n\n\nWanting to make some changes and meet some personal fitness goals I took to searching for a program to help motivate me further. Thankfully I found Bowery Crossfit on Instagram where they were promoting their periodic 6 week challenge.\n\nCaught between an impending trip abroad and a strong desire to get closer to my goals, I decided to make both happen. The team worked with me to schedule around my 2 week trip and with great effort on my part and considerable understanding on theirs, we made it happen.\n\nThe gym set one of two goals to beat for the challenge: either hit 25 pounds or 6% body fat in 6 weeks. The program was 600 dollars for the duration of the challenge split however is comfortable. I did it in 2 payments of 300. You can also pay as you go. There are a couple of weigh ins to monitor your growth. Upon final weigh in if you beat the challenge you have the option of a refund (check, refund to debit or credit card, or pay it towards a (slightly discounted?) Gym membership which you can structure with the staff accordingly.\n\nTo reach that goal they reccomend hitting the gym at least 3 times a week, though students could attend as many crossfit and HIIT classes as often as they wanted, provided they participate in 8 Crossfit Fundamentals training classes, before moving up to regular Crossfit classes. This can also be accomplished by taking HIIT sessions in combination.\n\nI found that the most effective strategy was to follow up my Crossfit Fundamentals class with a HIIT class, 1 hour each, led by a personal coach guiding the class. Depending on how many people signed up for the session, you could even have a 1 on 1 personal training session with the coach if you were the only one who came. Even for larger groups, you still get more individual attention.\n\nIt seems crazy but you can do it and much more if you try.

My goal was to lose 6% body fat, which seemed impossible at the time of the orientation. But I made it, thanks to all the awesome people I've met in this gym!\n\nI had a very helpful and encouraging fitness/nutrition coach, Chris. If you do the challenge, they will assign you a coach that will guide you through the whole journey.\n\nAlong with that, the fitness coaches I've met through the Foundations, Crossfit and HIIT classes who I'm so grateful for. They make sure you are doing the work out safely and with the right form, but also that you are pushing and challenging yourself.\n\nThe athletes/students who work out in the gym are also very friendly, and there is a sense of community that you just want to keep coming back and get stronger with everybody.\n\nI love this gym and I would give more than 5 stars if I could!",
            "Scam alert!\n\nI wish I read these reviews prior to signing up for the 6 week challenge. I was motivated and hopeful, especially due to prior positive crossfit experiences at other gyms and learned a big lesson about reading reviews first.\n\nTo be clear:\nThe 6 week challenge which is falsely advertised as free costs $632. If you lose 25 pounds they say you get your money back. Doing the math, this type of program endorses disordered exercise and eating. It's not healthy to lose that amount of weight in 6 weeks They exploit those that have unrealistic goals, financially.\n\nPersonally, I am writing because I was supposed to start the 6 week challenge right before COVID and they continued to bill be throughout the gym closures. I explained that I would be willing to transfer the money I already paid into a regular membership following COVID and they refused. I called my credit card company since it is illegal to charge for a gym that is closed due to COVID. The credit card company advised to file a claim. They responded by calling collections. I am confident that the credit card company will handle this for me, but am sickened by these practices overall. Mostly, I am genuinely worried about the mental health of potential consumers in the future.\n\nThe actual classes are extremely variable since the staff are not well trained. The staff themselves told\nme that they are not treated properly and that there are is little, inconsistent communication with management. It shows in the classes, and the workouts are not as effective as other crossfit programs I have done as a result.",

I got an \"ok\" text message.\n\nMonths later, I get a charge on my credit card. I was connected to Joe, who wanted to charge me for another month as a cancelation fee, which clearly is not part of the contract, and refused to give me credit for the month charged.\n\nAfter many back and forth emails, he finally understood and agreed a proper notice was given and no extra charges were to be charged to my account. I have on an email with his own words agreeing to this.\n\nThey stole my money, he is a thief. I had to call my credit company to dispute the charge. They settled to give me a refund, which I was happy. But later, they send me to collections???? For something he agreed and settled?? Talk about ethics.\n\nStay away from this gym, there are far better gyms with better customer service and honesty than WillyB. They are scammers, and as much as I hate to say this: they deserve to close for their terrible customer service ethics.",
            "I participated in Bowery Crossfit's Crossfit classes in summer 2018, when they were doing their Summer of Strength programming that involved more regular strength components (squat, deadlift, OHP). The coaches (I mainly had Kai, Jeff, and Ryan M.) are really friendly and encouraging. They push each person appropriately. They and my classmates made me feel good about my strengths and motivated to work hard on my weaknesses. I'm terrible at Assault bike WODs but never felt bad about finishing last as everyone cheered me on. Kai plays the perfect music for Crossfit in my opinion. It helps me push and keep going when I would usually just rest for a bit.\n\nI do think sometimes coaches let students get away with bad form during Olympic lifts (not catching low enough which can slow down progress, or catching with the back at an angle that looks dangerous to me) so wouldn't recommend pushing yourself too hard on those here. I am not a coach, but my first Crossfit box had an Olympic weightlifting-specific coach who competes at the national level, and my opinion on form comes from taking classes with him. This isn't an Olympic lifting gym, obviously, so I wouldn't dock Bowery stars for not being focused on Olympic lifting. I think Crossfit and specifically Bowery Crossfit do a great job of easing people into lifting and teaching the basics safely. I don't think you would get injured as a beginner or intermediate-level athlete here. Like, I wouldn't worry unless you're cleaning 1xbw as a woman or 1.5xbw as a man and trying to clean more.\n\nI switched to their open gym level of membership when the school year started as the Crossfit class times didn't work well with my course schedule and I also didn't fancy the return to more typical Crossfit programming without regular strength training. They have a good selection of equipment, and you can pay a bit extra for key card access to the gym outside of normal business hours. Their open gym hours are never crowded, so I've always had space for everything I've wanted to do. I dislike waiting for the squat rack at my university gym, so the open gym level of membership was well worth it for me. Ryan O. keeps everything well maintained and handled all my membership transitions and replied to my various emails smoothly and promptly.\n\nI'm now trying out another gym that's focused on powerlifting. My resting heart rate went from around 60 bpm to around 53 bpm while I was doing Bowery's Crossfit classes, and now it's back at around 60 bpm, lol. Bowery is great for conditioning and learning the basics of strength training, as it's a lovely, inclusive environment with cool people. If you're new in town, you could make friends easily here, as there are social events once in a while, and people often take the same class time. If you care about Oly enough that this review turns you off, but not enough to go to an Oly-exclusive gym, try Crossfit NYC Flatiron. Bowery is great for drop-ins as I think it's only $30, which is on the cheaper side for a Crossfit drop-in, and they're very responsive to email if you need help setting it up logistically.",
            "I took the 6 Week Challenge and loved my experience at both the Willy B Bowery and Tribeca locations. The trainers, the equipment, the results- everything was excellent\n\nThe trainers are very knowledgeable. I had never done CrossFit before and, while I had done weight training, rowing and kettlebell classes elsewhere, I was able to learn and grow as an athlete. If there were movements that were too advanced for my skillset, the trainers were able to help modify some of the more advanced movements so that over time I could achieve the advanced movement safely and correctly.\n\nThe gym itself is fantastic. They just gave the Tribeca space a complete makeover and its great atmosphere to workout in. All the equipment is well maintained and cleaned regularly. Its a very safe and amazing space to workout.\n\nAnd thanks to the previous two things, I got some amazing results with which I am incredibly pleased. I lost 6% body fat which initially I thought was going to be pretty darn impossible to accomplish. But, with the help of my trainers in class and the diet plan that they gave me, I was able to crush my goals. My clothes are loose. I can see my abdominal muscles for the first time ever. Plus I have received quite a bit of notice from coworkers about my slimmer and trimmer build. It's been a major win\n\nThis program was so worth it. If you are looking to up your fitness goals, give Willy B CrossFit Bowery or Tribeca a try.",
            "Just finished a very challenging 6-week challenge at Willyb.fit.\nIt was intense and informative. I pushed myself to the limits thanks to Chris and all the trainers who motivated from day 1. I learned more about nutrition and adjusted to reach my goal. I am grateful and glad I took that challenge. I would recommend this program to anyone looking for real results in their daily workout routine!\nGo WillyB go!!",
            "I came in to WillyB Crossfit to take their 6 week challenge and didn't really know what to expect. It turned out to an awesome experience. I lost 6 percent of my body fat in just 3 weeks\nI took all my HIIT classes with Chris, he makes the classes fun and at the same time pushes you to do your best. Jeff was the person I took most of my crossfit classes and I am amazed of knowledgable he is in just about everything. He teaches you proper techniques so you won't get hurt and shows steps on how you can gradually work towards doing all exercises to the fullest.\nThe workout are tough but so much fun. I learned to do things I never would have attempted to do on my own going to the gym. The atmosphere is great and even the other member are friendly and supportive during class. They also have a few other locations in Brooklyn.",
            "Review of 6 week challenge:\n\n\n\nWanting to make some changes and meet some personal fitness goals I took to searching for a program to help motivate me further. Thankfully I found Bowery Crossfit on Instagram where they were promoting their periodic 6 week challenge.\n\nCaught between an impending trip abroad and a strong desire to get closer to my goals, I decided to make both happen. The team worked with me to schedule around my 2 week trip and with great effort on my part and considerable understanding on theirs, we made it happen.\n\nThe gym set one of two goals to beat for the challenge: either hit 25 pounds or 6% body fat in 6 weeks. The program was 600 dollars for the duration of the challenge split however is comfortable. I did it in 2 payments of 300. You can also pay as you go. There are a couple of weigh ins to monitor your growth. Upon final weigh in if you beat the challenge you have the option of a refund (check, refund to debit or credit card, or pay it towards a (slightly discounted?) Gym membership which you can structure with the staff accordingly.\n\nTo reach that goal they reccomend hitting the gym at least 3 times a week, though students could attend as many crossfit and HIIT classes as often as they wanted, provided they participate in 8 Crossfit Fundamentals training classes, before moving up to regular Crossfit classes. This can also be accomplished by taking HIIT sessions in combination.\n\nI found that the most effective strategy was to follow up my Crossfit Fundamentals class with a HIIT class, 1 hour each, led by a personal coach guiding the class. Depending on how many people signed up for the session, you could even have a 1 on 1 personal training session with the coach if you were the only one who came. Even for larger groups, you still get more individual attention.\n\nIt seems crazy but you can do it and much more if you try. Coach Mark gave me some excellent words of courage \"its okay to throw up but you can't give up\"; words to live by. One of the best coaches they have, he'll help push you to your limit, especially in the HIIT class, and he was very welcoming, the main reason I ended up taking the HIIT classes because he invited us to after the crossfit Fundamentals, which I didnt know we could do as students until he kindly encouraged us to if we wanted more of a challenge.\n\nI met with Abbee initially who handled my intake, where we spoke about time line , goals , process, and after signing the papers she handed my initial weigh in, so that we could track growth toward the 6 week challenge goal.\n\nAfter that I was set up with Chris as my accountability coach, who recommended that I use the myfitnesspal app to track my caloric intake and nutrition plan. All the main staff use in house texting numbers so you can reach out to ask questions and be pushy about it if you have to--pushy meaning persistent but respectful.\n\nThere are several coaches. Amanda is rarely at the Bowery location but she is easily the best agility and movement instructor (think yoga and similar). I got to work with her only once but it was so enjoyable. Mark is a work master he'll push you hard and motivate you and he's a champ. The other coaches are also very good. I worked with Kai and Jeff and Maria as well. All extremely well trained and knowledgeable.\n\nThey also are great about scaling the movements and the repetitions based on your current strength level, so you can do the workouts adjusted to your level.\n\nAsk ask and keep asking. Be proactive about it. The more you ask the more you interact with the coaches the more you'll get out of it. If you dont understand a process or a movement or parts of your nutritional plan ask and challenge and question. They can teach you good things and by questioning and doing your own research you can augment the process so you reach your goal faster and more efficiently.\n\nNot only did I hit the 25 pound weight loss goals I lost closer to 30 pounds, and if that wasnt enough I also broke 6% , closer to 7%.

My goal was to lose 6% body fat, which seemed impossible at the time of the orientation. But I made it, thanks to all the awesome people I've met in this gym!\n\nI had a very helpful and encouraging fitness/nutrition coach, Chris. If you do the challenge, they will assign you a coach that will guide you through the whole journey.\n\nAlong with that, the fitness coaches I've met through the Foundations, Crossfit and HIIT classes who I'm so grateful for. They make sure you are doing the work out safely and with the right form, but also that you are pushing and challenging yourself.\n\nThe athletes/students who work out in the gym are also very friendly, and there is a sense of community that you just want to keep coming back and get stronger with everybody.\n\nI love this gym and I would give more than 5 stars if I could!",
            "Scam alert!\n\nI wish I read these reviews prior to signing up for the 6 week challenge. I was motivated and hopeful, especially due to prior positive crossfit experiences at other gyms and learned a big lesson about reading reviews first.\n\nTo be clear:\nThe 6 week challenge which is falsely advertised as free costs $632. If you lose 25 pounds they say you get your money back. Doing the math, this type of program endorses disordered exercise and eating. It's not healthy to lose that amount of weight in 6 weeks They exploit those that have unrealistic goals, financially.\n\nPersonally, I am writing because I was supposed to start the 6 week challenge right before COVID and they continued to bill be throughout the gym closures. I explained that I would be willing to transfer the money I already paid into a regular membership following COVID and they refused. I called my credit card company since it is illegal to charge for a gym that is closed due to COVID. The credit card company advised to file a claim. They responded by calling collections. I am confident that the credit card company will handle this for me, but am sickened by these practices overall. Mostly, I am genuinely worried about the mental health of potential consumers in the future.\n\nThe actual classes are extremely variable since the staff are not well trained. The staff themselves told\nme that they are not treated properly and that there are is little, inconsistent communication with management. It shows in the classes, and the workouts are not as effective as other crossfit programs I have done as a result.",
            "I have mixed feelings about this. The staff is great, classes are good, great accountability coaches and awesome community.\n\nHowever, management is awful. They are scammers. Joe ( who refused to provide his last name and direct number) is the most horrible and greedy person I ever encounter. I take he is one of the owners.\n\nAfter the pandemic broke, I reached out to one of the coaches and asked for my membership to be cancelled, the reason being: no longer living in the city and financial hardships. I got an \"ok\" text message.\n\nMonths later, I get a charge on my credit card. I was connected to Joe, who wanted to charge me for another month as a cancelation fee, which clearly is not part of the contract, and refused to give me credit for the month charged.\n\nAfter many back and forth emails, he finally understood and agreed a proper notice was given and no extra charges were to be charged to my account. I have on an email with his own words agreeing to this.\n\nThey stole my money, he is a thief. I had to call my credit company to dispute the charge. They settled to give me a refund, which I was happy. But later, they send me to collections???? For something he agreed and settled?? Talk about ethics.\n\nStay away from this gym, there are far better gyms with better customer service and honesty than WillyB. They are scammers, and as much as I hate to say this: they deserve to close for their terrible customer service ethics.",
            "I participated in Bowery Crossfit's Crossfit classes in summer 2018, when they were doing their Summer of Strength programming that involved more regular strength components (squat, deadlift, OHP). The coaches (I mainly had Kai, Jeff, and Ryan M.) are really friendly and encouraging. They push each person appropriately. They and my classmates made me feel good about my strengths and motivated to work hard on my weaknesses. I'm terrible at Assault bike WODs but never felt bad about finishing last as everyone cheered me on. Kai plays the perfect music for Crossfit in my opinion. It helps me push and keep going when I would usually just rest for a bit.\n\nI do think sometimes coaches let students get away with bad form during Olympic lifts (not catching low enough which can slow down progress, or catching with the back at an angle that looks dangerous to me) so wouldn't recommend pushing yourself too hard on those here. I am not a coach, but my first Crossfit box had an Olympic weightlifting-specific coach who competes at the national level, and my opinion on form comes from taking classes with him. This isn't an Olympic lifting gym, obviously, so I wouldn't dock Bowery stars for not being focused on Olympic lifting. I think Crossfit and specifically Bowery Crossfit do a great job of easing people into lifting and teaching the basics safely. I don't think you would get injured as a beginner or intermediate-level athlete here. Like, I wouldn't worry unless you're cleaning 1xbw as a woman or 1.5xbw as a man and trying to clean more.\n\nI switched to their open gym level of membership when the school year started as the Crossfit class times didn't work well with my course schedule and I also didn't fancy the return to more typical Crossfit programming without regular strength training. They have a good selection of equipment, and you can pay a bit extra for key card access to the gym outside of normal business hours. Their open gym hours are never crowded, so I've always had space for everything I've wanted to do. I dislike waiting for the squat rack at my university gym, so the open gym level of membership was well worth it for me. Ryan O. keeps everything well maintained and handled all my membership transitions and replied to my various emails smoothly and promptly.\n\nI'm now trying out another gym that's focused on powerlifting. My resting heart rate went from around 60 bpm to around 53 bpm while I was doing Bowery's Crossfit classes, and now it's back at around 60 bpm, lol. Bowery is great for conditioning and learning the basics of strength training, as it's a lovely, inclusive environment with cool people. If you're new in town, you could make friends easily here, as there are social events once in a while, and people often take the same class time. If you care about Oly enough that this review turns you off, but not enough to go to an Oly-exclusive gym, try Crossfit NYC Flatiron. Bowery is great for drop-ins as I think it's only $30, which is on the cheaper side for a Crossfit drop-in, and they're very responsive to email if you need help setting it up logistically.",
            "I took the 6 Week Challenge and loved my experience at both the Willy B Bowery and Tribeca locations. The trainers, the equipment, the results- everything was excellent\n\nThe trainers are very knowledgeable. I had never done CrossFit before and, while I had done weight training, rowing and kettlebell classes elsewhere, I was able to learn and grow as an athlete. If there were movements that were too advanced for my skillset, the trainers were able to help modify some of the more advanced movements so that over time I could achieve the advanced movement safely and correctly.\n\nThe gym itself is fantastic. They just gave the Tribeca space a complete makeover and its great atmosphere to workout in. All the equipment is well maintained and cleaned regularly. Its a very safe and amazing space to workout.\n\nAnd thanks to the previous two things, I got some amazing results with which I am incredibly pleased. I lost 6% body fat which initially I thought was going to be pretty darn impossible to accomplish. But, with the help of my trainers in class and the diet plan that they gave me, I was able to crush my goals. My clothes are loose. I can see my abdominal muscles for the first time ever. Plus I have received quite a bit of notice from coworkers about my slimmer and trimmer build. It's been a major win\n\nThis program was so worth it. If you are looking to up your fitness goals, give Willy B CrossFit Bowery or Tribeca a try.",
            "Just finished a very challenging 6-week challenge at Willyb.fit.\nIt was intense and informative. I pushed myself to the limits thanks to Chris and all the trainers who motivated from day 1. I learned more about nutrition and adjusted to reach my goal. I am grateful and glad I took that challenge. I would recommend this program to anyone looking for real results in their daily workout routine!\nGo WillyB go!!",
            "I came in to WillyB Crossfit to take their 6 week challenge and didn't really know what to expect. It turned out to an awesome experience. I lost 6 percent of my body fat in just 3 weeks\nI took all my HIIT classes with Chris, he makes the classes fun and at the same time pushes you to do your best. Jeff was the person I took most of my crossfit classes and I am amazed of knowledgable he is in just about everything. He teaches you proper techniques so you won't get hurt and shows steps on how you can gradually work towards doing all exercises to the fullest.\nThe workout are tough but so much fun. I learned to do things I never would have attempted to do on my own going to the gym. The atmosphere is great and even the other member are friendly and supportive during class. They also have a few other locations in Brooklyn.",
            "Review of 6 week challenge:\n\n\n\nWanting to make some changes and meet some personal fitness goals I took to searching for a program to help motivate me further. Thankfully I found Bowery Crossfit on Instagram where they were promoting their periodic 6 week challenge.\n\nCaught between an impending trip abroad and a strong desire to get closer to my goals, I decided to make both happen. The team worked with me to schedule around my 2 week trip and with great effort on my part and considerable understanding on theirs, we made it happen.\n\nThe gym set one of two goals to beat for the challenge: either hit 25 pounds or 6% body fat in 6 weeks. The program was 600 dollars for the duration of the challenge split however is comfortable. I did it in 2 payments of 300. You can also pay as you go. There are a couple of weigh ins to monitor your growth. Upon final weigh in if you beat the challenge you have the option of a refund (check, refund to debit or credit card, or pay it towards a (slightly discounted?) Gym membership which you can structure with the staff accordingly.\n\nTo reach that goal they reccomend hitting the gym at least 3 times a week, though students could attend as many crossfit and HIIT classes as often as they wanted, provided they participate in 8 Crossfit Fundamentals training classes, before moving up to regular Crossfit classes. This can also be accomplished by taking HIIT sessions in combination.\n\nI found that the most effective strategy was to follow up my Crossfit Fundamentals class with a HIIT class, 1 hour each, led by a personal coach guiding the class. Depending on how many people signed up for the session, you could even have a 1 on 1 personal training session with the coach if you were the only one who came. Even for larger groups, you still get more individual attention.\n\nIt seems crazy but you can do it and much more if you try. Coach Mark gave me some excellent words of courage \"its okay to throw up but you can't give up\"; words to live by. One of the best coaches they have, he'll help push you to your limit, especially in the HIIT class, and he was very welcoming, the main reason I ended up taking the HIIT classes because he invited us to after the crossfit Fundamentals, which I didnt know we could do as students until he kindly encouraged us to if we wanted more of a challenge.\n\nI met with Abbee initially who handled my intake, where we spoke about time line , goals , process, and after signing the papers she handed my initial weigh in, so that we could track growth toward the 6 week challenge goal.\n\nAfter that I was set up with Chris as my accountability coach, who recommended that I use the myfitnesspal app to track my caloric intake and nutrition plan. All the main staff use in house texting numbers so you can reach out to ask questions and be pushy about it if you have to--pushy meaning persistent but respectful.\n\nThere are several coaches. Amanda is rarely at the Bowery location but she is easily the best agility and movement instructor (think yoga and similar). I got to work with her only once but it was so enjoyable. Mark is a work master he'll push you hard and motivate you and he's a champ. The other coaches are also very good. I worked with Kai and Jeff and Maria as well. All extremely well trained and knowledgeable.\n\nThey also are great about scaling the movements and the repetitions based on your current strength level, so you can do the workouts adjusted to your level.\n\nAsk ask and keep asking. Be proactive about it. The more you ask the more you interact with the coaches the more you'll get out of it. If you dont understand a process or a movement or parts of your nutritional plan ask and challenge and question. They can teach you good things and by questioning and doing your own research you can augment the process so you reach your goal faster and more efficiently.\n\nNot only did I hit the 25 pound weight loss goals I lost closer to 30 pounds, and if that wasnt enough I also broke 6% , closer to 7%. You can do it too! Just actually try.\n\nThe beauty of crossfit is functional fitness and that if you stick with it and ask questions and do it regularly you will learn the movements and will learn to recreate them and reproduce them at will, learning from some of the best trained coaches.\n\nOverall was an excellent experience. Would recommend it to others. Crossfit training is probably the best. A membership at Bowery crossfit gives you access to multiple locationa. I was always at 285 Grand Street location in the Bowery area of Manhattan.\n\nI liked it there, people were friendly, staff were nice. It was a great program and an excellent choice to do the challenge. And I beat the challenge too :) .",

            "I trained here for a month during the summer. Training was great, They have a weight section which they incorporate into their workout. location was very easy to get to but sometimes parking during the day can be crazy due to the alternate street parking. The owners were really nice. I orgiinally planned for 6 weeks. I spoke to them about 2 week rate extra and they were very acommodating. Too bad, I had to run back upstate to move into new house so I had to cut it short. I would probably come back next summer.",
            "If you're serious about fighting, you're probably not relying on Yelp to find a gym. If you're curious about this place as a gym, visit and talk to the owners Ray and his wife Liza. If you want to see how ignorant the guy ranting about racism is- take 60 seconds on the gym's Facebook page. People are expected to be respectful of each other- man or woman, young or old, experienced or not. People are there to train and get in shape. This isn't a place to jog on the treadmill while you watch TV or read a magazine.",
            "I love this gym! I was looking for a boxing gym for awhile and then heard from friends about the Brotherhood Boxing Club. I can't say enough about the fantastic super pro trainers, Coach Ray and his wife Liza and their 2 sons who train the youth boxers. The gym has a \"no harassment\" policy and they are very strict about it. Being one of the few women at the gym, I really appreciate how professional they are.\n\nMy training is mostly with Liza and the boxing portion of my training is with Coach Ray. Each day, they have a different training routine. For example, Mondays are Iron Cardio, Tuesdays it's all about weights and ab work and each day focuses on a different part of your body. With the workouts being changed regularly, you are never bored and it's very effective. Even when the gym has a lot people training, you always receive top notch one-on-one training, this is so unique to any gym I've been to. I love the family environment here and the camaraderie between everyone training. I started working out at the gym in April 2013, lost a significant amount of weight and gained muscle. Liza has been instrumental in my training for the marathon as well.\n\nI highly recommend this gym and for the price and the type of service they provide, it's a steal.\n\nYelena"

            "Solidcore -- I came, I saw, I conquered? Bareeelllyyyy but I did have an amazing time challenging my body.\n\nI've seen and read how tough Solidcore is and have now experienced said toughness. In short, Solidcore kicked my arse. In a good way!\n\nThis particular class on March 20 -- triceps and inner thighs at 1:15pm -- was a mixed bag of beginners and advanced. I am not gonna lie I was also a bit intimidated by the reformer and mirrors. You mean to tell me, I and everyone else have a view of my imbalance and missteps?! But everything turned out fine because 1: everyone is focused on themselves and 2: Portia B makes it that EVERYONE is comfortable.\n\nPortia knows the human body and was encouraging in her interactions with us. She acknowledged students by calling out each of our names, willing us to push through and give it all we got. She also came over and corrected forms (did that for me several times haha). One of my main takeaways is that small movements are impactful.\n\nYes, pilates is for the body. But I think it's more mental than anything. A good playlist helps with not focusing on the pain and Portia definitely delivered with the tunes. I needed all of the distraction I could get. I felt sore after class but accomplished.\n\nAnyone interested should sign up for a class. It's strenuous as a beginner but I would say it is worth the challenge.",
            "This solidcore location in Dumbo has the BEST tasting water out of all the locations I have been to. I don't know what filter they use or what they add to the water but it's crisp and cold and I could guzzle down a whole bottle after class. The studio space is fairly sizeable, with two rows of machines. However, the lobby space is a little small and cramped so I definitely would not recommend coming here early as there is not a lot of space to sit.",
            "Tried this place out for the first time to switch up my workout from running and weights. They have a really strict policy on being on time. More than 5 minutes late and basically out of luck. If you go during \"off peak\" hours aka before the studio opens to take an early class, you'll need a code to enter at the door. Try getting there 15 ish minutes early to get a locker and get settled into a machine. No one was at the front desk so I basically had to ask a classmate where to put my things and how to check in. Eventually headed into the class to find the instructor.\n\nShe took my name and led me to a machine. The machines are close to each other. Can't imagine how cramped it might feel if the class was full. The class will definitely work some muscles you normally wouldn't and felt challenging. I would have liked a little more hands on help for a first timer, but think I kept up ok. The one hour class goes by fast and the next group is in before you get a chance to chat with the instructor or anyone else. It would have been nice to have a little more gap between classes. A 6am class is a bit tough to get to on time with trains, but nice to do early. I'd recommend going on an empty stomach. A 630am class might be better.\n\nThey have 2 single gender neutral restrooms. They have a few personal care items you may use (spray deodorant, lotion, hair ties, etc.) You'll wipe down your machine with disinfectant wipes after class. They sell water and drinks. The lockers have their own locks built in that you can set. Blue stone lane coffee is just across the street and you're a short walk to the Brooklyn bridge if you want breakfast and take a walk after. Overall an okay workout to do once in awhile, but quite expensive.",
            "I've seen ads for this place about 100x on Instagram and since it was available on ClassPass I decided to give it a try. Everyone talks about how hard the class is and they def weren't lying. It's basically Pilates on steroids. It's a full body workout but they target certain areas depending on the schedule. Be prepared to do lots of slow, controlled movements to really feel the burn. They give you different options for each exercise depending on your level and if you need to pause and take a break you aren't shamed for it. The instructor I had (Hayley) was super sweet and walked around adjusting bodies as needed. The facility itself has free lockers and a bathroom but no actual locker room. They also give you a code to unlock the front door 15 min before class and the code stops working if you're more than 5 min late. Overall a good workout that I wouldn't mind trying again.",
            "I definitely had NO IDEA what I got myself into booking this class. I saw low impact but full body workout and so I went for it.\nLittle did I know, I would be drenched with sweat. This class will push you to the max but in such a low intensity way. Literally doing small micro movements yet I was sweating profusely. If you want to strengthen your core and muscles this is it. Each exercise isolates specific muscles and you work it until exhaustion. This specific class focused on inner thigh and I literally walked out feeling like I had noodles for legs.\nThe studio is quaint but super cute. I loved how new it felt. The A/C was just the right temperature. I absolutely loved my instructor. He was super welcoming and supported me throughout the class because I had no idea what I was doing. Also, we use reformers and you can either buy grip socks or go barefoot.\nI will be coming back!!",
            "First class at Solidcore! As a marathon runner, I'm generally a HIIT workout person and don't participate in slow paced workouts. A friend recommended Solidcore so I thought I'd give it a chance.\n\nOverall, I feel like it's not a great place if it's your first visit. When I walked in, I was asked my name and they said \"welcome\", that's all. I had to mention I'm new and then received a rushed intro to the space that was very poor. I made my way to a machine and my mistake was choosing the end most machine. The carriage was extremely sticky (maybe from the previous class?), so my shirt kept getting caught during the workout. The fan/cooling is non-existent at the last machine. I've been to possibly every type of fitness studio brand to exist in the northeast, and this was the first time I felt so uncomfortable with the lack of cooling that I left halfway through the class. Master coach Katie was fantastic and paid attention to newcomers and clearly tries her best to help everyone, but there was a decent amount of guests and I followed the moves of the other guests instead of feeling like I was being led by the coach. It felt confusing throughout. The parts of the workout that I did understand and was able to do was challenging, which I enjoyed! Little bursts of muscle contractions add up, so I appreciate the basis of Solidcore. I'd have to check out a different studio to compare the service, but this location personally wasn't it for me.",
            "Intense and effective! Clean facilities. I've gone several times and plan to return. Highly recommend :)\n\nThe exercises are a combination of strength and endurance. It's more than cardio and designed to burn fat + build muscle. Coaches come around and make adjustments to help with form, so I'm far less worried about injuries. I left each session with sore muscles and a shirt drenched in sweat.\nThe coaches are super positive, though they sometimes call instructions kinda fast. Andrew's Arms & Abs class was paced better than the others. Might be good for new members to arrive early and meet the coach to understand instructions in advance.\n\nBusiness checks vaccination records. Lockers are available and the bathrooms are clean.",
            "Great space and challenging work out.\nThe instructors are very encouraging throughout this muscle shaking session.",
            "I've been itching to go back to group fitness classes after the last year and a half, and I found that megaformer classes are small and distanced enough for my pandemic comfort level. Solidcore's studio is very clean and modern, and the equipment seems new and well-maintained. I also appreciate the dim, moody lighting so I can do this highly sweat-inducing workout in peace.\n\nI've tried a handful of megaformer studios in LA and Brooklyn and the instructor can make a world of difference especially when you're new. Andrew gives clear directions and paces you instead of leaving you hanging in a position wondering \"wtf even is a french twist\" and \"surely a masseuse will have to untwist my back tomorrow.\" The 50 minutes actually fly by here - a feat for a megaformer class.\n\nAs of 8/23 they'll be requiring all students to be vaccinated. I also felt comfortable enough to wear a mask throughout class.",

She acknowledged students by calling out each of our names, willing us to push through and give it all we got. She also came over and corrected forms (did that for me several times haha). One of my main takeaways is that small movements are impactful.\n\nYes, pilates is for the body. But I think it's more mental than anything. A good playlist helps with not focusing on the pain and Portia definitely delivered with the tunes. I needed all of the distraction I could get. I felt sore after class but accomplished.\n\nAnyone interested should sign up for a class. It's strenuous as a beginner but I would say it is worth the challenge.",
            "This solidcore location in Dumbo has the BEST tasting water out of all the locations I have been to. I don't know what filter they use or what they add to the water but it's crisp and cold and I could guzzle down a whole bottle after class. The studio space is fairly sizeable, with two rows of machines. However, the lobby space is a little small and cramped so I definitely would not recommend coming here early as there is not a lot of space to sit.",
            "Tried this place out for the first time to switch up my workout from running and weights. They have a really strict policy on being on time. More than 5 minutes late and basically out of luck. If you go during \"off peak\" hours aka before the studio opens to take an early class, you'll need a code to enter at the door. Try getting there 15 ish minutes early to get a locker and get settled into a machine. No one was at the front desk so I basically had to ask a classmate where to put my things and how to check in. Eventually headed into the class to find the instructor.\n\nShe took my name and led me to a machine. The machines are close to each other. Can't imagine how cramped it might feel if the class was full. The class will definitely work some muscles you normally wouldn't and felt challenging. I would have liked a little more hands on help for a first timer, but think I kept up ok. The one hour class goes by fast and the next group is in before you get a chance to chat with the instructor or anyone else. It would have been nice to have a little more gap between classes. A 6am class is a bit tough to get to on time with trains, but nice to do early. I'd recommend going on an empty stomach. A 630am class might be better.\n\nThey have 2 single gender neutral restrooms. They have a few personal care items you may use (spray deodorant, lotion, hair ties, etc.) You'll wipe down your machine with disinfectant wipes after class. They sell water and drinks. The lockers have their own locks built in that you can set. Blue stone lane coffee is just across the street and you're a short walk to the Brooklyn bridge if you want breakfast and take a walk after. Overall an okay workout to do once in awhile, but quite expensive.",
            "I've seen ads for this place about 100x on Instagram and since it was available on ClassPass I decided to give it a try. Everyone talks about how hard the class is and they def weren't lying. It's basically Pilates on steroids. It's a full body workout but they target certain areas depending on the schedule. Be prepared to do lots of slow, controlled movements to really feel the burn. They give you different options for each exercise depending on your level and if you need to pause and take a break you aren't shamed for it. The instructor I had (Hayley) was super sweet and walked around adjusting bodies as needed. The facility itself has free lockers and a bathroom but no actual locker room. They also give you a code to unlock the front door 15 min before class and the code stops working if you're more than 5 min late. Overall a good workout that I wouldn't mind trying again.",
            "I definitely had NO IDEA what I got myself into booking this class. I saw low impact but full body workout and so I went for it.\nLittle did I know, I would be drenched with sweat. This class will push you to the max but in such a low intensity way. Literally doing small micro movements yet I was sweating profusely. If you want to strengthen your core and muscles this is it. Each exercise isolates specific muscles and you work it until exhaustion. This specific class focused on inner thigh and I literally walked out feeling like I had noodles for legs.\nThe studio is quaint but super cute. I loved how new it felt. The A/C was just the right temperature. I absolutely loved my instructor. He was super welcoming and supported me throughout the class because I had no idea what I was doing. Also, we use reformers and you can either buy grip socks or go barefoot.\nI will be coming back!!",
            "First class at Solidcore! As a marathon runner, I'm generally a HIIT workout person and don't participate in slow paced workouts. A friend recommended Solidcore so I thought I'd give it a chance.\n\nOverall, I feel like it's not a great place if it's your first visit. When I walked in, I was asked my name and they said \"welcome\", that's all. I had to mention I'm new and then received a rushed intro to the space that was very poor. I made my way to a machine and my mistake was choosing the end most machine. The carriage was extremely sticky (maybe from the previous class?), so my shirt kept getting caught during the workout. The fan/cooling is non-existent at the last machine. I've been to possibly every type of fitness studio brand to exist in the northeast, and this was the first time I felt so uncomfortable with the lack of cooling that I left halfway through the class. Master coach Katie was fantastic and paid attention to newcomers and clearly tries her best to help everyone, but there was a decent amount of guests and I followed the moves of the other guests instead of feeling like I was being led by the coach. It felt confusing throughout. The parts of the workout that I did understand and was able to do was challenging, which I enjoyed! Little bursts of muscle contractions add up, so I appreciate the basis of Solidcore. I'd have to check out a different studio to compare the service, but this location personally wasn't it for me.",
            "Intense and effective! Clean facilities. I've gone several times and plan to return. Highly recommend :)\n\nThe exercises are a combination of strength and endurance. It's more than cardio and designed to burn fat + build muscle. Coaches come around and make adjustments to help with form, so I'm far less worried about injuries. I left each session with sore muscles and a shirt drenched in sweat.\nThe coaches are super positive, though they sometimes call instructions kinda fast. Andrew's Arms & Abs class was paced better than the others. Might be good for new members to arrive early and meet the coach to understand instructions in advance.\n\nBusiness checks vaccination records. Lockers are available and the bathrooms are clean.",
            "Great space and challenging work out.\nThe instructors are very encouraging throughout this muscle shaking session."

Helpful.\nHours: 7 days/wk. On par with other NYC Blinks.\nOverall: one of the busier Blinks I have been to which is the sole reason I goto other Blinks despite this one being closest to me. Basement gym with no windows but bright lightning system. Despite the fact its a busy gym, the layout where the weight and cardio machines make it manageable. Independent stretch area for foam rolling and light weights. The free weight, bench and Smith machine area is very very busy and everyone is on top of each other even at the quiet parts of the day.

            "TL:DR - I LOVE THIS GYM AND HEARTILY RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT HESITATION.\nSpecial mention to Aaliyah (I think she is one of the managers) who is great!\n\nAm visiting NY for work at the moment and needed a good gym as I'm a dedicated gym goer who follows a specific plan. Hotel gyms are never good enough.\n\nI cased out a few gyms local to my hotel before arriving and reached out to them. I got an email straight back from Blink from Aaliyah who was really friendly and told me to pop in when I arrived.\n\nTo be honest, I'd pretty much decided I would go to Equinox as that was nearer (Blink was the furthest away) but when I went for a look around, I wasn't that impressed.. It was OK - but nothing special and the $50 a day fee as a guest would have meant forking out $150 on nothing.\nI popped into Planet Fitness down the road which was OK (but the staff didn't seem to know what day of the week it was) and then decided to carry on down the road to Blink just to give it a quick look.\n\nI asked for Aaliyah and - two days after the email - she remembered me by name which I thought was a really nice touch. She sorted me out with a guest pass and has been on the desk with a smile and a welcome every morning which is great. That kind of thing really makes a difference.\n\nI go between 5-8 each morning before work.. It gets busy about 6:30/7am but even though it's busy, it's not stressful like some gyms. It's not a huge space but they seem to have a lot of equipment (and a lot of the obvious pieces that people gravitate to) so there isn't a huge line or it ever feels really rammed because it's laid out really well. And the equipment is all great. Normally at the cheaper end of the price range, equipment is tatty and worn but everything I've used here is in great, serviced condition and it's clean. And people are friendly and respectful. The place has a really nice feel!\n\nIf I was a local, I'd join this place without hesitation and would recommend you do it if you are looking for somewhere. Meanwhile, I'll just keep visiting whenever I'm in town.",

I've reported it numerous times.\nNobody follows through that members are wiping down the machines after they use them. I feel like I'm on staff cleaning. Some morning members jump around from free weights to machines like it's their own private gym meanwhile they're not cleaning/ wiping anything down and they leave their weights on the floor which is a dangerous tripping hazard. I see it every morning.\nThen when I go to use the machine it's all sweaty and stained.

The strength machines have thick layers of dirt on them (I have multiple photos)...people have even resorted to drawing smiley faces in the filth.

            "I've been to this Blink Fitness recently and they definitely have COVID precautions set in place. When you go in, they check your temperature. The lockers that you can use are spaced out, so every 3/4 are unavailable for use. The mats where you can stretch and work on abs have been removed and there's sticker-like writing on the floor that says \"Stretch here\" so you are spaced apart 6ft from others.

Helpful.\nHours: 7 days/wk. On par with other NYC Blinks.\nOverall: one of the busier Blinks I have been to which is the sole reason I goto other Blinks despite this one being closest to me.

It was OK - but nothing special and the $50 a day fee as a guest would have meant forking out $150 on nothing.\nI popped into Planet Fitness down the road which was OK (but the staff didn't seem to know what day of the week it was) and then decided to carry on down the road to Blink just to give it a quick look.\n\nI asked for Aaliyah and - two days after the email - she remembered me by name which I thought was a really nice touch. She sorted me out with a guest pass and has been on the desk with a smile and a welcome every morning which is great. That kind of thing really makes a difference.\n\nI go between 5-8 each morning before work.. It gets busy about 6:30/7am but even though it's busy, it's not stressful like some gyms. It's not a huge space but they seem to have a lot of equipment (and a lot of the obvious pieces that people gravitate to) so there isn't a huge line or it ever feels really rammed because it's laid out really well. And the equipment is all great. Normally at the cheaper end of the price range, equipment is tatty and worn but everything I've used here is in great, serviced condition and it's clean. And people are friendly and respectful. The place has a really nice feel!\n\nIf I was a local, I'd join this place without hesitation and would recommend you do it if you are looking for somewhere.

            "I've been to this Blink Fitness recently and they definitely have COVID precautions set in place. When you go in, they check your temperature. The lockers that you can use are spaced out, so every 3/4 are unavailable for use. The mats where you can stretch and work on abs have been removed and there's sticker-like writing on the floor that says \"Stretch here\" so you are spaced apart 6ft from others. Water fountains are not available for use, and the foams that you use for barbells aren't available. For this specific location, you can still bring a guest but always double check before you do so.

            "Don't fall for their bait and switch. They say things like \"$15 a month!\" or \"$10 a month with $1 down! No commitment!\" But they're lying. When you agree to the terms and conditions... you're agreeing to all sorts of hidden fees in the fine print. Cancelation Fees, Maintenance Fees ... whatever they can think up. So you think you're paying $15 a month and they're actually charging your credit card basically whatever they feel like. Not to mention: totally unsanitary. Overcrowded. And \"masks optional\" even during Omicron. Such a bummer because our neighborhood really needs a good gym.",
            "My goal is to visit as many Blink gyms in NYC.\n\nLocation: downstairs\nElevator: yes\nConvenience: in boerum/cobble hill, closest to F/G at Smith St stop; I guess you can walk from 2/3/4/5 at Borough Hall or A/C/F/R at Jay St. This is the closest Blink to my residence.\nGym Size: medium size, maybe even a tad small vs other Blinks. downstairs (like a basement gym). Square shaped layout.\nLocker Room Size (Men's): on the smaller size. Not the smallest like Noho\nEquipment (outside of the basics mentioned below): sandbags, heavy Kettlebells (60, 70lbs), TRX, battle ropes, plyo boxes\nCrowdedness: On the busier side given its location to residents, students, workers. Despite the fact there is a Planet Fitness down the block and other gyms in the area, the old NYSC (now turned into a UFC Gym) closed across the street and likely increased the crowdedness here. I was told by staff its busiest Mon to Wed from 3pm to 9pm. Weekends are manageable.\nCleanliness: clean. Saw a dedicated cleaning lady.\nStaff Friendliness: Good. Above average. Helpful.\nHours: 7 days/wk. On par with other NYC Blinks.\nOverall: one of the busier Blinks I have been to which is the sole reason I goto other Blinks despite this one being closest to me. Basement gym with no windows but bright lightning system. Despite the fact its a busy gym, the layout where the weight and cardio machines make it manageable. Independent stretch area for foam rolling and light weights. The free weight, bench and Smith machine area is very very busy and everyone is on top of each other even at the quiet parts of the day. Note they had wipes that were not wet. You need to add your own spray which is near the wipes.\n\n*Unless noted, assume all Blink gyms have locker rooms, water fountain, stretch area, dumbbells, kettlebells (up to 50lbs), smith machines, weight machines, cardio equipment (Rower, treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, stairclimber), showers, wipes, Towel machine (pay separate charge). Assume you can scan in via App or Apple Wallet/Watch\n**Note: I am a Blink user with entry possibility of all their NYC area gyms via an Add-on to my Classpass membership. (I did not want to deal with Blink corporate in case I needed to cancel and wanted to avoid a startup fee or annual charge). I do not take showers at the gym and tend to go off-peak hours.",
            "If you need a basic gym, Blink has a good model that can keep you fit and mostly satisfied. This location is all subterranean and has no natural light. It is all on one floor so it feels a bit smaller than others. It's kept up mostly well and clean. They don't have very many hand sanitizer stations and some are not operating. Overall it's what you expect for the price and you can check how crowded it is on the app so you're not waiting for popular machines. I come here to mix it up from my regular home Blink.",

Awesome trainers as well.\n\nI started working with Austin Stoner (@stones_throne.sc) after having long standing issues with my back. Physical therapy let me down because it was boring and expensive but Austin took a really smart approach to my recovery, while also working on general strength training, mobility, and wellness. After the 3rd session I already felt relief on my back and after 2 months I started waking up feeling like a new person, having zero pain or discomfort. It's been over 5 months working with him and can honestly say I've never felt better in my adult life.\n\nWould recommend Austin to anyone who feels physically stuck and is looking for a change in body and mind. He is an incredibly positive, uplifting guy, who takes a well researched approach to physical health and I'm very grateful for him and his work.",

I read some of the other review and I get it -- seems like things were a bit of a mess with COVID and the transition with the previous gym.\n\nBut, I've been going here for two months now and I literally love it. They have everything you could want from tough classes to tons of cardio machines to turf to lots of lifting areas. They told me it's the largest gym in the area!\n\nI'd recommend starting with the 3-day trial (FREE) to see how you like it :)\n\nYou also get one free personal training session when you sign up which is cool! I loved it so much I stayed with that trainer -- Shant\u00e9 is the best!!\n\nThings are clean, the staff is nice, and they even have a little steam room.\n\nPrices are $100 a month which is a great alternative to the pricy gyms around. Also I heard they have a student discount, so be sure to ask if you are!",
            "This gym is great! There's a lot of space and 3 turf areas, more squat racks than you need, deadlift platforms, strongman equipment, a reverse hyper machine, and plenty of cardio equipment. They also have a yoga room, boxing room, and cycling room, which are all mostly empty unless there are classes. Classes also come with a membership, so you don't have to pay extra to take them. Locker rooms are really nice too, and the showers as well. The only thing I would hope they add in the future is a better sauna. But overall this gym is the best gym I've been to in all of Brooklyn.",
            "I've been a member here for about 6 months and it has gotten so overcrowded. There isn't even room to change in the locker room at this point and there are rarely enough weights for classes. Classes are also very crowded as well. They open several spots with class pass which is questionable given how many members want/do attend.\n\nOtherwise, classes are decent and it's affordable and instructors are passionate! It's a clean gym with good equipment that could be a great spot with adequate space to move!",

There's a lot of space and 3 turf areas, more squat racks than you need, deadlift platforms, strongman equipment, a reverse hyper machine, and plenty of cardio equipment. They also have a yoga room, boxing room, and cycling room, which are all mostly empty unless there are classes. Classes also come with a membership, so you don't have to pay extra to take them. Locker rooms are really nice too, and the showers as well. The only thing I would hope they add in the future is a better sauna. But overall this gym is the best gym I've been to in all of Brooklyn.",
            "I've been a member here for about 6 months and it has gotten so overcrowded. There isn't even room to change in the locker room at this point and there are rarely enough weights for classes. Classes are also very crowded as well. They open several spots with class pass which is questionable given how many members want/do attend.\n\nOtherwise, classes are decent and it's affordable and instructors are passionate! It's a clean gym with good equipment that could be a great spot with adequate space to move!",
            "Best gym in Williamsburg... very central and a cool, rustic vibe inside. Has everything you need no matter the experience level and everyone is very welcoming. Awesome trainers as well.\n\nI started working with Austin Stoner (@stones_throne.sc) after having long standing issues with my back. Physical therapy let me down because it was boring and expensive but Austin took a really smart approach to my recovery, while also working on general strength training, mobility, and wellness. After the 3rd session I already felt relief on my back and after 2 months I started waking up feeling like a new person, having zero pain or discomfort. It's been over 5 months working with him and can honestly say I've never felt better in my adult life.\n\nWould recommend Austin to anyone who feels physically stuck and is looking for a change in body and mind. He is an incredibly positive, uplifting guy, who takes a well researched approach to physical health and I'm very grateful for him and his work.",

Don't get me wrong, I really like a lot of what they play, but it's kind of feels weird hearing hardcore 90s rap in a gym in Williamsburg lol. It's like being a kid in the suburbs wearing tin foil grills on myspace. But the gym itself is fine, I have no complaints.",

Since then, this has been brought to court in 2023 and a stipulation was signed that the money would be paid back.

            "A decent, lifting-centric gym at an unbeatable price and location.\n\nSince moving to mid-town, I've been on the hunt for the gym that fits my needs. I mainly focus on mid-weight lifting and stretching, not a big cardio head. Having an open studio space is a plus too. Mid-city fulfills most of these criteria.\n\nThe gym is location at a great location, albeit a bit busy due to tourists. The underground and dark nature will be a pro or con depending on the person; I find it nice as it mentally isolates one into the \"gym mindset\" without external distractions.\n\nPlenty of squat, deadlift, and bench press spots, and the typical strength training machines that other NYSC/Crunch gyms would have. NO studio space with is a downside for me, but otherwise is perfect for the price. They run constant promotions so don't be afraid to ask or go on instagram!\n\nCan get busy post work hours (5-7pm) as any NYC gym would. Great plus is that they are open quite late on weekdays.",
            "Eric, thanks for your review and hope you enjoy your membership!",
            "Visiting and got a workout in at this awesome gym.\n\nIt's fully equipped and can handle the needs of serious lifters (I'm not one, but I do appreciate their capabilities and equipment!).\n\nIt's clean, well-maintained, and has a good, focused atmosphere. You can tell that it is run with care and passion.\n\nThey were nice to honor a free workout promo I found online, but they have day and weekly passes too.",
            "Thanks for visiting us and very glad you had a good workout!",
            "Found me a local Iron Paradise while spending the weekend in NYC.\n\nThankfully stumbled upon this gem of a place which was waking distance from my hotel. Was able to get in & have a solid workout.\n\nNice old school fee & ambiance to it. You really get the feel for that old school Bodybuilding mentality.\n\nNice selection of equipment, great lighting and overall a solid gym to get a decent pump going.",
            "Ethan, thanks so much for coming in! We hope to see you again in the future!",
            "This gym really impressed me. The location is great and the culture seems positive and friendly. The owner is really nice and welcoming to tourists. Each piece of equipment was hand selected by the owner, which is apparent from some of the unique pieces I came across. There's a nice selection of pre-workout, protein, and carb/electrolyte drinks near the entrance, as well as a water fountain in the back. The gym layout is peculiar but the owner made it work. The entire gym is very clean, with sanitizing wipes spread out around the gym floor. This gym is especially appealing for those who are into bodybuilding or Olympic lifting primarily, but it can appeal to a wider audience as well.\n\nI definitely recommend this gym!",

After increasing my search radius, I found Mid City Gym and I've been pretty pleased with my experience so far.\n\nThe monthly membership is a great deal for what you get and sign-up was super easy. There's a nice selection of machines and set-ups despite the space being a bit smaller than what I'm used to back home. The gym and locker rooms are very well-kept and clean!\n\nI also like the crowd here. Everyone's clearly here to work out and lift heavy which always adds to my daily motivation. Highly recommended.",

            "Guest review 6/25/22 (Saturday morning 8 to 930a)\n\nDay pass 25$ plus tax\n\nInteresting little gym with a Miami Beach club vibe. Lots of industrial feel with house music blasting on the speakers.Inside a Basement with a variety of good equipment, in good condition. Overall, nice little gym with a \"bottle of water at Disneyland\" price tag. Not good for families. Good for bodybuilders, really good for power lifters, not good for cross fitters.\n\nI want to start off with the positives. This gym has equipment picked out by someone who lifts and not some corporate accountant. Lockers are clean and comfortable. It has a great variety of good equipment and good handles for the cables. Mag handles and hammer strength plate loaders always make for a great workout.\n\nIt has a good variety of bars stacked in the corner near the 4 power racks (mostly good for squats) and again in another area for dead lifts. There is a rogue fitness power rack in the deadlift area that offers more space (weirdly there are not mirrors for the power racks.). Really superb variety of bars. The lighting situation (the gym is pretty dim) is peculiar for lifting heavy weights. It is decent in the squat area, though. Also peculiar is the no mirrors for the deadlift area.\n\nThe reason I couldn't give this gym quite a 5 stars (it's really like a 4.5) is that there are a few touches missing. If you're paying almost 30$ for a visit, you should get top of the line.\n\nNo bikes (or rather 2 bikes in a corner near the front desk), and the elliptical I used was a bit wobbly (I'm 6 foot, and a solid 230 lbs)\nNo wet or dry sauna.\nNot good mirror situation in parts of the gym\n\nGym equipment isn't separated into cohesive areas. It feels like looking around and picking a spot to post up. Leg workout is pretty choppy.\n\nOverall, would recommend. Definitely a different experience.",

            "After,trying the gym one time I decided to joined, they explained no strings attached Yada Yada, I found out I had a medical issue and for now I can't exercise as I need it. I talked to many front desk people and wrote to the manager by email. They totally ignored me and continued taking money out of my account even thou, I had never actually been able to do one lonely class or use the place. It's been 6 months and they refused to listen or stop taking money put of my account. I don't even have a copy of the so call contract. The manager didn't answer my calls and the front desk is not able to direct me to the person in charge.\nThe management sucks and I really hate the way they do business. They just want your money even thou I already contact them 10 times is no resolution. Be aware of small printing and the front desk tactics to confused and make you sign forms before entering for the such called \"complementary \" tryout.\nI don't recommend this place to no one.",

Highly recommend the classes for people who are looking to have someone help them achieve their fitness goals.

            "They have a truly unbelievable number of non-refunded \"Holiday closures\". This month alone, October 2016, they are closed 4 full days and 2 additional half days, no refunds or pro-rate for the days they are closed despite it being 6 days in one 31 day period which is 19% of the month. They claim this is because they are a \"Jewish Center\" but in 2015 they also closed for days over Christmas despite Hanukkah having ended on December 14th that year. Again, no refund or rebate for the multiple days of closure.\n\nThe consistently low hygiene standards are also a major problem here. At least twice a week I find I have nothing to wipe down or sanitize equipment with and I only ever use the bathrooms or showers in an absolute emergency due to lack of cleanliness, I would rather walk home. I have remained a member here for over a year due exclusively to the total lack of ANY other gyms nearby.\n\nWhen I became a member, they fraudulently promised me that membership fee [which is already WAY too high at $55.00 considering the services offered are what you would get on a $10.00 Planet Fitness membership and that Manny Cantor Fitness has a much lower standard of cleanliness than any Planet Fitness] would never be raised as long as I kept my membership current. I have kept my membership current but my monthly rate has been raised without my consent, they just keep hitting my credit card.\n\nThink twice before signing up.",

            "There are so many upsides to this Equinox tour of NYC that I've been doing. For those of you that don't already know, I've been visiting every NYC Eq location and ranking the shower situations. I'm pretty familiar with most NY neighborhoods now and my butt is also very firm. Highly recommend you all do this.\n\nWest 50th Street was quiet and chill af on the Saturday morning I visited. I took a spin class there, which left me feeling recharged with endorphins and very sweaty. The instructor mentioned that the spin studio would be renovated soon, so there's something to look forward to. While this location is fine for working out, the locker room and showers aren't the best. The showers are actually some of the smallest and most dismal I've tried so far.\n\nThe definitive Equinox shower power ranking (so far):\n1. Rockefeller Center\n2. Williamsburg\n3. Gramercy\n4. East 92nd\n5. Sports Club\n6. Brookfield Place\n7. East 74th\n8. SoHo\n9. Wall St\n10. Bond St.\n11. Highline\n12. Tribeca\n13. Park Ave\n14. Flatiron\n15. Columbus Circle\n16. East 54th\n17. West 92nd\n18. Bryant Park\n19. Orchard Street\n20. Greenwich Ave\n21. West 50th\n22. East 85th",
            "I love this Equinox. I workout here when traveling from L.A. Not super busy in the mornings so there isn't a wait for equipment. Clean.\n\nStaff and management has been very friendly.\n\nI would recommend this location.",
            "Thank you for the feedback, Steve! We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us and we look forward to seeing you in the club soon.",
            "It's freezing here during the winter, the men's locker room is crowded and small, and the soap dispenser is broken or missing in some places. I mean overall it's clean and has some good but limited exercise selection, but you're definitely not getting your money if you're used to going to almost any other equinox club.\n\nNot the manager's or the staff's fault - they're awesome and really try to make the best out of what they have. Service is attentive and keeps the place clean. Just that this place is unloved by equinox and you get the feeling like it's falling apart a little",
            "Hi there. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We are sharing what you've mentioned with the appropriate teams now.",
            "This place is overly crowded, there are always lines during rush hour for any piece of equipment, to get to your locker or to the showers. Locker rooms are quite worn -- the floors are always damp because it is of a very small size and close to showers, the showers sometimes goes from freezing cold to extremely hot water, the steam room is incredibly small and always crowded. Despite the great people servicing the lock rooms, they just can't keep up with the mass amount of people in a small little room. The staff here is incredibly great and nice, customer service has been great. Just the gym itself is sub-par for what you pay",
            "Among all the Equinox locations I've been to, this one is my favorite.\n\n+ Great variety of classes at convenient times\n+ Not overly crowded (never have to wait for a shower/blow drier)\n+ Always clean (most locations are always clean so this is obvious)\n+ Really nice people (for the most part)\n+ Great location (a block from Barclay's building)\n\n- There is construction going on around it which makes it tough to find if you're unfamiliar with it\n- It's located on the bottom floor (ie no windows.. but its NYC, so what do you expect?)",
            "I'm so glad I quit equinox... not only does your dues go to support orange Hitler but when there are 8 people sitting on the steam room the cleaning guy repeatedly turns OFF the steam. THAT IS NOT LUXURY. I'm gonna laugh so hard when they have to start closing locations.",
            "DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get anything from the Juice Press inside this location. The smoothie I just ordered from there was literally the worst smoothie I've ever had in my life, never coming back to this juice press. Major bummer, cause it was my go to, especially the last employee there, who made the BEST smoothies, every single time, but alas, the new girl is not it.",

            "One of more neglected Equinox clubs in the city. Convenient location and easy to get to, 1 train is not even a block away. Hesitate to return here though since it's very crowded considering the square footage on weekday mornings and evenings. Difficult to get a shower right away after a workout since there is always a line to get into the showers in the morning, I learned this and never go in the mornings, just the evenings when I am not as rushed. Recommend getting a spot in advance using their app if signing up for classes. Unlikely you'll squeeze in last minute for weekday classes. Only 50% packed on weekends and it's great, though they have shorter business hours than most other Equinox.\n\nEverything is kept spotless, towels are clean, has a coat check, enough lockers, shower items are always stocked. Pleasant front desk staff and most of the trainers are nice. There was one trainer who would insert himself and give comments that are unsolicited, which is fine but it's annoying when he keeps pushing you to take personal training classes with him. I would consider working with a personal trainer but if I do, it won't be with him. Would recommend this location and it is cheaper than others if getting one location membership, though if you have access to all Equinox in the city, there are definitely nicer and newer ones like Columbus Circle or Hudson Yards locations.",

The smoothie I just ordered from there was literally the worst smoothie I've ever had in my life, never coming back to this juice press.

            "I visited this Equinox recently on a business trip since it was just down the street from my hotel. In terms of location, it's super convenient since it's right near the entrance to the 1 train. The front desk staff were super nice and they helped me out when there was an issue with my barcode now showing up properly in the Equinox app (aka the buggiest app in the world).\n\nThe club is pretty nice but does feel a bit cramped in some places (especially downstairs in the area near the squat racks). Also, some of the equipment is not as new as it is in some other Equinox clubs I've visited. The men's locker room is small although the staff do work hard to keep it clean.\n\nOverall, it's a decent club if it's close by to where you are. However, by the end of the week I ended up walking up to the Columbus Circle club since it was larger and had newer equipment.",

Highly recommend you all do this.\n\nWest 50th Street was quiet and chill af on the Saturday morning I visited. I took a spin class there, which left me feeling recharged with endorphins and very sweaty.

The space consists of a Boxing ring which is probably the gym's main attraction, weight area, small group fitness studio and a few cardio machines. No amenities like locker rooms or juice bars.

Then they pair you up with another student in the class and you rotate between holding pad and punch, following the trainer's demonstration. I personally feel that you can have a great work out if you and your partner are at the same level, in any case, I always get a better work out here than going to boxing gym where you don't get much pad work time and only rotate between different stations.",
            "(KEEP IN MIND THIS IS A BLOG POST TURNED YELP REVIEW.)\n\nI have been following Gotham Gym on instagram for about two years now and have always been curious as to why so many models train there. In my mind I imagined this pristine, super high-end gym with vanity lighting, spa amenities and a very intimidating \"you can't sit with us\" vibe. I mean this place is where Victoria's Secret model's get runway ready, there must be a huge luxury component to it, right?\n\nTo my surprise when I arrived there I encountered a small gym tucked away in the West Village with nothing too glitzy or glamorous about it. If you don't know about it you can probably walk by it and not even notice it. Except you will thanks to the amount of models and celebrities who hang out there. The space consists of a Boxing ring which is probably the gym's main attraction, weight area, small group fitness studio and a few cardio machines. No amenities like locker rooms or juice bars. What I really loved about the space is the fact that it has so much natural light, which is something very rare in New York especially at a gym.\n\nI went there for a one on one personal training session and was very close to dying at certain points but the adrenalin rush kept me alive (so poetic I know.) I will definitely have to try and review a group class very soon. The gym is membership based and classes are included in your monthly membership, personal training is not. However you can pay for a drop in class and the studio is also included in Classpass.\n\nAfter trying this gym I have to say I was really happy with my training session which consisted mostly of boxing. Boxing is a great workout for the body and for the mind. It's a mix of cardio, weight training, flexibility and agility. There is no other workout that encompasses so many elements, which is probably why so many models have made it their workout of choice. Now I still don't know why so many celebrities flock to this particular studio but my guess would be that the main reason is because Hugh Jackman works out there. The other reasons I can think of is that Gotham is located in a very quiet corner of a very quiet neighborhood and unlike most boxing studios this one doesn't stink, it actually smells great!\n\nThe only downside I saw is that they don't have a real locker room with a changing area, what they have is a room with old wooden lockers and you have to bring your own lock. This would make my gym to office transition very complicated since you sweat buckets when you box and they have no showers! Other than that this gym deserves an A plus and I will definitely be back to see if I throw some more punches.",
            "Best workout, best gym vibe and so much fun.\nFor a one on one training session, ask for Simeon. He is beyond....you will get the best workout, learn so much, laugh and not know where the time went. Off the chart!",
            "This actually looks like one of the best places in NYC for kickboxing. I actually got the pleasure of meeting rob a few months ago and you can tell that he has actually put his heart and soul into this place.\nHe really does care about what he dose and his staff having the true NY vibe. Everything that you get here is designed to be a true NY experience. I love the layout and interior of the building. I also did like the awesome tee shirts and other things that they had to choose from in there as well.\nI actually did love the layout of the place and the hardwood floor. I wasn't quite ready to get a class in when I met with him due to a sports injury. Then I did actually leave the city to deal with some family issues. I do look forward to taking some classes there when I return to the city at the end of the year.\nI've been following this place on instagram and I do feel like it is actually a good place for progressive training and getting into the best shape of your life. It was good to meet with you Rob. I look forward to getting in a workout in the near future. There were just so many amazing quality's about this place. Its too great not to pass up.",
            "A neat, one-of-a-kind elite boxing gym.\nWell-organized, clean, full of equipment. The staff is kind and professional.\nI got to work out with Frank and Sonny, both are the real deal with lots of experience.\nWhenever I needed an advice, trainers were there for me to help and explain things in detail.\nSome very dedicated and knowledgeable people come here, inspires to see their skills.\nThis place is a good combination of tough and chill. Nobody's going to bother you here.\nHands down the best gym in the city."

            "Got to try this spot out through ClassPass. Liftonic offers a great workout in perhaps a slightly under appreciated or under served workout mode these days, as it is heavily weight-based. I enjoyed the intense workout and truly appreciated the encouraging vibe and great workout tips from the instructor, Scott.\n\nThe workout spot is ample but could be better organized--the exercises require benches and floor space and occasionally I didn't know where to go or feel like I had sufficient floor room between benches.

            "Found this studio through ClassPass and took my first class yesterday. I absolutely loved it! It was tough in the best way. No cardio just weigh training but you get to select the weight you're comfortable with for each exercise and the instructor is very attentive on your form. Will definitely be back.",
            "I attended a bicep, chest, abs class. We did a good balance of exercises for those muscles. We were told to get 4 different sets of weights to use for different exercises. The instructor made good use of the music, as it was very dynamic. We exercised to the beat and also to his counts.\n\nIt was a large class of about 20 people, so you won't be getting much individual attention on form. The instructor wears a mic but sometimes the music is so loud you still can't hear some of what he says. But there are plenty of TVs mounted on the ceiling, so even if you're in the back you can usually see what new exercise the instructor is showing.\n\nIt's a very clean studio. After class, everyone was using the wet wipes to wipe their benches, mats, etc. There are 2 small changing rooms and a large bathroom. They provide bathroom products such as dry shampoo, wet wipes, hair ties, and a hairdryer. There's also clothes racks to hang your coats and an open locker cubicle to put your bags.",
            "Great gym for those that want structured strength training where they take you through the tempo and reps needed and forces you to reach hypertrophy. The core and ab session also burns. This is a good class for those strength fiends and those that hate cardio. The biggest con for me was getting the right dumbbells. Getting right set of dumbbells feels literally like the Hunger Games. You had to get there early enough to get first dibs on the dumbbells you want and need. Or else you'll be left with over 65 lbs or under 17 lbs. and for a chest press session that's either going to kill you or underwhelm you. I wish they enforced for clients to only get 1 or 2 sets of dumbbells at most or tailor the workout to only force folks to only use 2 sets of dumbbells. I was seeing other clients in the class literally take 8 pairs of dumbbells of what seems like the whole rack of dumbbells when they only use like 1 or 2 pairs out of those. Especially when the room is dark, it's quite awkward to ask other people to share the dumbbells with you and also having to wipe the shared dumbbell between sets takes time.\n\nOverall great gym, but the dumbbell Hunger Games turned me off a little bit.",

After class, everyone was using the wet wipes to wipe their benches, mats, etc. There are 2 small changing rooms and a large bathroom.

            "Great gym for those that want structured strength training where they take you through the tempo and reps needed and forces you to reach hypertrophy. The core and ab session also burns. This is a good class for those strength fiends and those that hate cardio. The biggest con for me was getting the right dumbbells. Getting right set of dumbbells feels literally like the Hunger Games. You had to get there early enough to get first dibs on the dumbbells you want and need. Or else you'll be left with over 65 lbs or under 17 lbs. and for a chest press session that's either going to kill you or underwhelm you. I wish they enforced for clients to only get 1 or 2 sets of dumbbells at most or tailor the workout to only force folks to only use 2 sets of dumbbells. I was seeing other clients in the class literally take 8 pairs of dumbbells of what seems like the whole rack of dumbbells when they only use like 1 or 2 pairs out of those. Especially when the room is dark, it's quite awkward to ask other people to share the dumbbells with you and also having to wipe the shared dumbbell between sets takes time.\n\nOverall great gym, but the dumbbell Hunger Games turned me off a little bit.",

            "Great trainers. Well designed workout that pushes you past that, \"I don't wanna do it phase\"",
            "Found the gym through ClassPass but was only allowed to take one class. I really enjoyed the \"trading day\" cardio class. The furthest was great, pace was challenging, the instructor was clear, had good form, motivating, and made the class altogether fun!\nHope to go back soon and try out their other classes.",
            "Very friendly and helpful instructor and members. A little intimidating at first because everyone else was more advanced than me, but they went out of their way to personalize instructions and make me comfortable.",
            "This isn't just the best gym, it's also the most amazing community of people helping you become the strongest version of yourself (mentally and physically). I found Training Lab when I first moved to the city in the heart of the pandemic. I had always been someone who took typical gym classes and workouts...but Training Lab changed everything I thought I knew about working out. I was instantly humbled by the rigor and complexity of the workouts (and learned that I was previously not doing a single barbell movement with proper form or intensity). After about 2 years of coming here, I can say that I've never had a repeat or boring class. The classes are programmed to make you stronger in every way as long as you keep coming. The trainers are the most elite as they come, they have always had extreme patience, care, and faith in my abilities to succeed even when I didn't have it myself. Because of Training Lab and the supportive, loving, community that is fostered, I came back every day wanting to be the best version of myself. I went from barely being able to use a 35Lbs barbell to completing SERE, Hyrox, and finding a new confidence in the gym (and myself) that helps me be the best/strongest version of myself every day. The workouts are hard, a mix of strength and cardio, but the reward of completing them is unmatched. When you're surrounded by successful, kind, supportive people, it makes going every day that much better. Do yourself a favor and take the first step of being the best version of yourself by taking a class at Training Lab. It'll be the best decision you could make for yourself. See you soon :)\n\n(That picture is me after about 6 months of only Training Lab workouts)",
            "I always feel safe and accepted at Training Lab. Although I don't have a ton of experience working out, the instructors are always happy to help out and give pointers. I never feel judged or any negative energy coming here, even if I'm the least experienced in the room. I just always have a great experience coming here and I will continue coming in the future!",

            "I am not a member here but stayed over on a reciprocal club membership ... after my stay we've determined if we ever do end up moving to NYC down the line (which isn't unlikely) we will apply for membership here. I happened to pick the week where all the facilities were getting maintenance done ... no pool, no big gym, etc. However, that didn't even bother me because I was soaking everything else in. I have been to lots of private clubs ... Harvard Clubs in NYC, Boston, Jonathan Club in LA, etc. and this has been one of the best experiences I've had.\n\nFirst of all ... let's address the 'snooty' factor some people attach to this club. Yes, the rules here are VERY specific. If you are wearing anything but a suit you'll be stopped and asked to show a membership card or room key. Some of the staff can come across a bit condescending. But people have gotten so comfortable with doing whatever they feel like in public (cell phone use/facetiming in stores, sweatpants or t-shirts in a nice restaurant, etc.) it was actually VERY refreshing to have an oasis of class and decorum. It was a tad annoying not being able to walk through the lobby in sneakers or jeans at first ... but after a while, it was nice to be in an environment where you aren't sitting next to someone wearing pajama type clothing in a public place while watching a youtube video like a shared lounge was their own bedroom.\n\nFrom a reciprocal standpoint, the facilities are not open to those from other clubs, unless they are an overnight guest. You can't have dinner here without staying the night ... which is the case at most of the nicest clubs. The rooms here are the nicest out of any private club I've visited ... and some of the most affordable ($180 - $300). While they aren't necessarily 5 star ... most guest rooms at other private clubs are kind of gnarly and dated. These were IMMACULATELY clean (I know you aren't supposed to tip at private clubs, but I couldn't resist leaving a little something for the maids who left this room looking brand new!) and modern. It felt like a nice business class hotel and I loved everything from the bed to the sheets to the Moulton Brown bath products. The air conditioning blew ICE COLD, which was fantastic as it was almost 100 degrees in NYC.\n\nThe staff here was fantastic for the most part. There were a few duds ... but for the most part, everyone was fantastic and competent. From the gentleman at the front desk who complimented me on my suit each day with a smile ... to the gentleman at the front door who recognized me each time I came in ... for the most part, despite the somewhat draconian rules and the signs everywhere which promote them, everyone made me feel like a welcomed guest here. Even the women in the club's shop were fantastic and friendly despite my trying on almost every sweatshirt in the shop. (the gear here is all name brand stuff ... and the prices are not much higher, even with the logos, than you'd find at a chain sports store!)\n\nOne of the other reviewers mentioned that the club looks 'old and tired'. I've been in a lot of clubs which have had a 'fake old' look which doesn't work ... or modernize so much that they lose their identity/history. NYAC is the real deal ... leather couches, marble walls and silver athletic trophies. This is one of the most prestigious private clubs in the world for a reason! It has old world charm and gives you an idea what it was like in the golden days of NYC (and London). The Harvard Club in NYC has a much grander main hall, likely due to the higher ceilings. However, the overall vibe in this club was much better. I will admit that the upstairs lounge was a bit weird in that it felt like nobody ever used it and the lights were always off.\n\nThe absolute showstopper here is the roof deck. The best views of Central Park in all of NYC! I have stayed at The Essex House, the (now gone) Ritz Carlton and other Central Park hotels and have not seen a better view than from the roof deck at NYAC. You'll need prior reservations, even if staying, so make sure to make them in advance ... but SO worth it to have a few drinks when they open at 5 p.m. or to see the city lit up at night. We had a meal in the Tavern restaurant, which was great as well. (the main dining room was closed when we were there) The Tavern food is excellent ... which is NOT the case with most private clubs. While the menu tends to be pretty 'predictable' here, the food was prepared great.\n\nIf you get the chance to join ... or visit this club ... DO! It's one of the finest 'old world' clubs in the country, in my opinion. If you don't like a bit 'stuffy' it might not be for you ... if you'd rather have a drink at The Plaza vs. Katsuya, this place is for you. Once you settle into the regulations, you realize why they are there. It's like swimming in a pool of class and refinement. Thank you to the staff for making me feel so welcome.

            "I was a member of the New York Athletic Club for many years, and there is not a club in the New York area that compares to this establishment. Its tradition, dedication of supporting amateur sport athletes, its architecture, and most of all its resolute diligent staff.\n\nI had been out of touch with the Club for a few years, and this afternoon I entered the New York Athletic Club to an enthusiastic welcome from members of the staff that I will never forget.\n\nNYAC is a private social club and athletic club founded in 1868. They presently have about nine thousand members with two facilities, one being the City House and the other Traverse Island located in Westchester. The club membership is by invitation only.\n\nThe club offers many sports, including rowing, wrestling, boxing, judo, fencing, swimming, basketball, rugby, soccer, tennis, racquet ball, handball, squash, snooker, lacrosse, and water polo. They have an incredible billiards room worth the visit.\n\nOn the 2nd Floor of the City House building. one will find the Hall of Fame, which is well worth the visit. There is no doubt that you will recognize many of the names of the athletes noted in the hall. The club has sponsored many Gold, Silver, and Bronze Medal Olympic Athletes.\n\nIf you know anyone that is a member, it will sure be worth your while visiting the Club. Leave yourself a day, or more the tour the facilities. Its history and tradition will live on in New York forever.",

I have stayed at The Essex House, the (now gone) Ritz Carlton and other Central Park hotels and have not seen a better view than from the roof deck at NYAC.

If you stay here make sure you're dressed nicely when checking in and leaving out. Or you have to use the side entrance.\n\nOnce we arrived the valet took our vehicle. Check in was easy, we forgot our vaccine cards but was able to breeze through once we got those. There are so many amenities like the gym and spa to take advantage of.\n\nThe room was on the small side but very comfortable. The bathroom had its own heated light just in case you get chilly after a shower.\n\nAll in all I'm happy I got to experience such an exclusive place because the membership fee is very pricey lol.",
            "We are members of the NYAC. Tonight a large group of us went to the Tap Room and had the worst experience. The host was so rude and the servers were highly incompetent- the food was beyond mediocre. I'm embarrassed to be a member.",

With a large number of hotel rooms, rooftop bar and event function views of Central Park and Manhattan it is difficult to find a better location. The basketball courts are great with top flight athletic facilities. The bar lounge is wonderful with a large open Club space and great service---I would expect nothing less. The Friday seafood combination of shrimp cocktail and oysters is spectacular along with a top flight of mixologists and bar selections. I also liked their Buffalo Chicken Nuggets avoiding the mess with Club attire--blazer, collared-dress shirts sc (without) jeans or sneakers. The coat check services are great!

            "Beautiful old building conveniently located overlooking Central Park that's just overflowing with tradition. Strict dress codes that are enforced, however exceptions are made when checking in and checking out of the hotel. Additionally, there is an alternate entrance and exit if you're going out for a run or a more casual event and don't meet the dress code. What really sets this place apart though is the staff. They are all incredibly helpful. Before we even checked in, I called ahead to verify the valet parking and check in and the person who I spoke to was wonderful and really started our stay off on a positive note. When we arrived we were immediately greeted by Joe, who was the absolute star of our stay. He gave us some great recommendations for restaurants and things to do. He has a special gift of making you feel comfortable and after about two minutes you feel like you've known him forever! Thank you to the entire staff for making us feel so welcome!",

            "I was a member of the New York Athletic Club for many years, and there is not a club in the New York area that compares to this establishment. Its tradition, dedication of supporting amateur sport athletes, its architecture, and most of all its resolute diligent staff.\n\nI had been out of touch with the Club for a few years, and this afternoon I entered the New York Athletic Club to an enthusiastic welcome from members of the staff that I will never forget.\n\nNYAC is a private social club and athletic club founded in 1868. They presently have about nine thousand members with two facilities, one being the City House and the other Traverse Island located in Westchester. The club membership is by invitation only.\n\nThe club offers many sports, including rowing, wrestling, boxing, judo, fencing, swimming, basketball, rugby, soccer, tennis, racquet ball, handball, squash, snooker, lacrosse, and water polo. They have an incredible billiards room worth the visit.\n\nOn the 2nd Floor of the City House building. one will find the Hall of Fame, which is well worth the visit. There is no doubt that you will recognize many of the names of the athletes noted in the hall. The club has sponsored many Gold, Silver, and Bronze Medal Olympic Athletes.\n\nIf you know anyone that is a member, it will sure be worth your while visiting the Club.

            "I am not a member here but stayed over on a reciprocal club membership ... after my stay we've determined if we ever do end up moving to NYC down the line (which isn't unlikely) we will apply for membership here. I happened to pick the week where all the facilities were getting maintenance done ... no pool, no big gym, etc. However, that didn't even bother me because I was soaking everything else in. I have been to lots of private clubs ... Harvard Clubs in NYC, Boston, Jonathan Club in LA, etc. and this has been one of the best experiences I've had.\n\nFirst of all ... let's address the 'snooty' factor some people attach to this club. Yes, the rules here are VERY specific. If you are wearing anything but a suit you'll be stopped and asked to show a membership card or room key. Some of the staff can come across a bit condescending. But people have gotten so comfortable with doing whatever they feel like in public (cell phone use/facetiming in stores, sweatpants or t-shirts in a nice restaurant, etc.) it was actually VERY refreshing to have an oasis of class and decorum. It was a tad annoying not being able to walk through the lobby in sneakers or jeans at first ... but after a while, it was nice to be in an environment where you aren't sitting next to someone wearing pajama type clothing in a public place while watching a youtube video like a shared lounge was their own bedroom.\n\nFrom a reciprocal standpoint, the facilities are not open to those from other clubs, unless they are an overnight guest. You can't have dinner here without staying the night ... which is the case at most of the nicest clubs. The rooms here are the nicest out of any private club I've visited ... and some of the most affordable ($180 - $300). While they aren't necessarily 5 star ... most guest rooms at other private clubs are kind of gnarly and dated. These were IMMACULATELY clean (I know you aren't supposed to tip at private clubs, but I couldn't resist leaving a little something for the maids who left this room looking brand new!) and modern. It felt like a nice business class hotel and I loved everything from the bed to the sheets to the Moulton Brown bath products. The air conditioning blew ICE COLD, which was fantastic as it was almost 100 degrees in NYC.\n\nThe staff here was fantastic for the most part. There were a few duds ... but for the most part, everyone was fantastic and competent.

            "Great place to stay! Amazing service. You guys I am obsessed I would definitely stay another night in this cozy elegant atmosphere.",
            "Beautiful old building conveniently located overlooking Central Park that's just overflowing with tradition. Strict dress codes that are enforced, however exceptions are made when checking in and checking out of the hotel. Additionally, there is an alternate entrance and exit if you're going out for a run or a more casual event and don't meet the dress code. What really sets this place apart though is the staff. They are all incredibly helpful. Before we even checked in, I called ahead to verify the valet parking and check in and the person who I spoke to was wonderful and really started our stay off on a positive note. When we arrived we were immediately greeted by Joe, who was the absolute star of our stay. He gave us some great recommendations for restaurants and things to do. He has a special gift of making you feel comfortable and after about two minutes you feel like you've known him forever! Thank you to the entire staff for making us feel so welcome!",
            "Spent two days as a guest in the hotel portion of the club. Our room was exceptional - including two bathrooms. Unfortunately, we did not have the chance to eat in the restaurants, but the posted menus looked great. The staff was accommodating and we had a late check out time. The dress code is strict, but it fits the club.",
            "I stayed here two nights as a guest of a member. I did not like the confusing, dated, snobby rules. No jeans, no sneakers, no ball cap, must wear a suitcoat to use certain bars and restaurants in the building. The billing is confusing. They say the host must pay and the guest reimburse the host, but this is not always enforced. Sometimes they allow the guest to pay. Next time I will just book a room at a normal hotel in NYC where I don't feel second-class."

            "I discovered Conbody thru the Classpass app on Christmas when they were one of the few gyms open for me to do a workout. Since Christmas I have become addicted to their workouts even though each workout destroys me, but in a good way. The class is basically 40 minutes of intense cardio and agility training. I thought I was pretty fit before but doing the Conbody workout the last month and a half has taken my cardio fitness to another level. Love this workout and the guys who run this place!",
            "Love all of the instructors. The workouts are just perfect. They have so many options on the schedule, it's great if you need flexible hours (both super early or later in the evening). On top of that, I feel like I'm supporting a fantastic cause and wish more businesses would take inspiration from Conbody.\n\nMy biggest priority is not causing past injuries to come back, and I've never felt any pain besides the obvious soreness from getting back in shape. You should do your best to keep up to get the most out of the workout, but there's no pressure to push yourself too hard and you can modify the exercises if you need to.\n\nSome instructors and their workouts are tougher than others, but once you get to know them all, you can pick your favorites and create a more balanced class schedule if you're not looking to have the toughest instructor every single time.\n\nOn top of all that, the music is always SO good to workout too, their playlists and energy make the time just fly by. Love it here.",
            "Amazing! This was such a great workout that taught me many great body-weight exercises that came in handy because I could do them at home during COVID. I really like their mission to help formerly incarcerated people to re-enter the workforce. The instructors are super helpful and friendly and really help to shift public perception.",

            "WHAT A WORKOUT.\n\nI came across ConBody when searching for outdoor fitness classes due to Covid and then saw a buy 1 class get 1 free deal, so figured it was the perfect chance to try this out.\n\nThe classes are described as prison style boot camps and are focused on body weight cardio with virtually no breaks. (By the end you'll really appreciate the 10 second stops where the trainers talk through the next round and you can chill for a minute). They're fast paced and intense but the trainers put out a great balance of motivation and hype and excitement that kept me pushing myself. The playlists are spot on. Exactly what you need to keep yourself in the right headspace. Mark and Derek were both awesome.\n\nI had one class at Lion's Gate Field outside, and the second was actually indoors but felt okay because it was only 6 people, they had an air filtration system in the studio, and everyone was great about wearing masks when walking around. Really appreciated that Mark checked in after the indoor class to see how it went and if there was anything that didn't feel comfortable due to Covid/space between mats/etc.\n\nI am wildly sore after doing an 11am Sunday class and an 8am Monday class back to back, but it was so worth it. Will definitely be coming back.",
            "A gym called Conbody describing itself as a prison style bootcamp might sound like the gimmick of the century until you learn that the founder was inspired to start this business from his own time as an inmate and that they only hire formerly incarcerated people to teach the fitness classes. All you need to do to believe in the magic is to take a class yourself where they don't use a single prop. They show you how much muscle you can build with just body weight alone and boy is it killer.\n\nIf you're used to utilizing weights and equipment to provide resistance during your routines you might be surprised by how difficult this no frills class is. The founder has taught every class that I've taken here and he never cuts anyone any slack as he yells at us to do crab walks, bear crawls, wall sits, leg lifts, push ups and plank jacks. Every additional set will leave you crying out in pain while you shoot dirty looks at the sadist that is the instructor telling you there are several sets left with no rest in between. The playlist is always full of bangers that help me get through such a difficult workout.\n\nLike many other gyms that were open these last couple of weeks before all nyc gyms were ordered to temporarily close, Conbody made an announcement that they were taking extra steps to sanitize the space to prevent the spread of covid-19. During class however, the instructor continued to encourage everyone to high five him and each other, and had us do partner work where we were all up in each other's sweat and breath. If I wasn't shook before about my risk of exposure I sure as hell was after this class. There was some dissonance there and it's definitely for the best gyms are ordered to close for now.\n\nWhen the dust settles and it's safer to have a stranger's sweat all over me I will venture back for an hour of torture, learning the ropes with former inmates.",

Since Christmas I have become addicted to their workouts even though each workout destroys me, but in a good way. The class is basically 40 minutes of intense cardio and agility training. I thought I was pretty fit before but doing the Conbody workout the last month and a half has taken my cardio fitness to another level. Love this workout and the guys who run this place!",
            "Love all of the instructors. The workouts are just perfect. They have so many options on the schedule, it's great if you need flexible hours (both super early or later in the evening). On top of that, I feel like I'm supporting a fantastic cause and wish more businesses would take inspiration from Conbody.\n\nMy biggest priority is not causing past injuries to come back, and I've never felt any pain besides the obvious soreness from getting back in shape. You should do your best to keep up to get the most out of the workout, but there's no pressure to push yourself too hard and you can modify the exercises if you need to.\n\nSome instructors and their workouts are tougher than others, but once you get to know them all, you can pick your favorites and create a more balanced class schedule if you're not looking to have the toughest instructor every single time.\n\nOn top of all that, the music is always SO good to workout too, their playlists and energy make the time just fly by. Love it here.",
            "Amazing! This was such a great workout that taught me many great body-weight exercises that came in handy because I could do them at home during COVID. I really like their mission to help formerly incarcerated people to re-enter the workforce. The instructors are super helpful and friendly and really help to shift public perception.",
            "That\u2019s awesome! Thanks so much for your support",
            "WHAT A WORKOUT.\n\nI came across ConBody when searching for outdoor fitness classes due to Covid and then saw a buy 1 class get 1 free deal, so figured it was the perfect chance to try this out.\n\nThe classes are described as prison style boot camps and are focused on body weight cardio with virtually no breaks. (By the end you'll really appreciate the 10 second stops where the trainers talk through the next round and you can chill for a minute). They're fast paced and intense but the trainers put out a great balance of motivation and hype and excitement that kept me pushing myself. The playlists are spot on. Exactly what you need to keep yourself in the right headspace. Mark and Derek were both awesome.\n\nI had one class at Lion's Gate Field outside, and the second was actually indoors but felt okay because it was only 6 people, they had an air filtration system in the studio, and everyone was great about wearing masks when walking around. Really appreciated that Mark checked in after the indoor class to see how it went and if there was anything that didn't feel comfortable due to Covid/space between mats/etc.\n\nI am wildly sore after doing an 11am Sunday class and an 8am Monday class back to back, but it was so worth it. Will definitely be coming back.",
            "A gym called Conbody describing itself as a prison style bootcamp might sound like the gimmick of the century until you learn that the founder was inspired to start this business from his own time as an inmate and that they only hire formerly incarcerated people to teach the fitness classes. All you need to do to believe in the magic is to take a class yourself where they don't use a single prop. They show you how much muscle you can build with just body weight alone and boy is it killer.\n\nIf you're used to utilizing weights and equipment to provide resistance during your routines you might be surprised by how difficult this no frills class is. The founder has taught every class that I've taken here and he never cuts anyone any slack as he yells at us to do crab walks, bear crawls, wall sits, leg lifts, push ups and plank jacks. Every additional set will leave you crying out in pain while you shoot dirty looks at the sadist that is the instructor telling you there are several sets left with no rest in between. The playlist is always full of bangers that help me get through such a difficult workout.\n\nLike many other gyms that were open these last couple of weeks before all nyc gyms were ordered to temporarily close, Conbody made an announcement that they were taking extra steps to sanitize the space to prevent the spread of covid-19. During class however, the instructor continued to encourage everyone to high five him and each other, and had us do partner work where we were all up in each other's sweat and breath. If I wasn't shook before about my risk of exposure I sure as hell was after this class. There was some dissonance there and it's definitely for the best gyms are ordered to close for now.\n\nWhen the dust settles and it's safer to have a stranger's sweat all over me I will venture back for an hour of torture, learning the ropes with former inmates.",

Roberto has been one of the best people that has come across my fitness journey- from helping me sign up, answering all my questions, having pleasant exchanges in the gym, and motivating me. He is very polite and kind. The price for membership is a great value and they have classes if you wish to sign up.",
            "We are glad to hear that the gym meets all your expectations and needs Nigora. We are glad to have you as part of our CompleteBody Family!",
            "Before signing up, I received a call from Ethan answering my questions and a complimentary fitness assessment from a trainer named Kirk! He gave me great fitness advice, perfected my form, and told me the exercises I should focus on. I also like that he asked me my fitness goals before starting so I felt that he really tailored the exercises to my specific goals (I had doubts about my push ups). I also liked that there was zero pressure to sign up.\n\nI signed up today and so far, I can say this place is very clean and they have a pool! It's not crazy busy which is nice. They have a cardio section, a weight section, and an outdoor area. Membership is only 99 a month with tax so it's affordable.",
            "Ahmad is terrific. I was in the pool and he was most attentive and helpful\nI am elderly and appreciate his thoughtfulness",
            "We absolutely love Eddie, who gives our kids swimming lessons at CompleteBody Midtown East! Fantastic teacher, great with kids. Five stars!",
            "Complete is a greet gym\nIt offers the complete experience: from strength training and cardiovascular exercises as well as 1-1 training. As an added bonus the pool is wonderful too\nThe best part of all of this is the staff. Dennis at the front desk had a warm welcoming smile for each and every client and makes you feel like family.",
            "Eddy is the best swim instructor for kids. My daughter was afraid and he makes them feel so comfortable while pushing them to get better. We love Eddy Spagetti",
            "Thank you for the review Ronnie, Eddie is great :)",
            "Eddie is a great swim teacher.\nThe kids love him and trust him and he pushes them outside of their comfort zone while keeping them smiling.",
            "Amazing amenities, clean, spacious, and the customer service goes above and beyond. I was especially impressed with Roberto Porras whom helped me with my initial membership and has been able to navigate me through finding a PT, passes for family, and any other concerns or needs I had.",
            "This gym is awesome! First off, a POOL? In midtown?! I love that I can get a wide range of workout in from swimming to Pilates to weightlifting done at CB. Not to mention all the classes they host & fitness groups they can put you in contact with (PT, trainers, stretch lab).\nThe atmosphere is chill & the staff are super friendly. Roberto made the sign up process so smooth & wasn't putting too much pressure on us to sign immediately (even though we liked it right away). Everything about CB is what I want in a gym: an comfortable place to go & sweat out the day's troubles!",
            "I love CompleteBody, a lot of space, great equipment, and incredible variety of classes. Roberto is the absolute best; he showed me around, helped me experience every aspect of the gym and everything it has to offer. He's always around to assist if you need anything and is online 24/7 to provide customer support if you email him! With other gyms, I've spent more money only to find the classes were always full or the equipment always taken, but I've always had smooth workouts at CompleteBody!",
            "I'm really glad I joined this gym. Roberto has been so helpful since my initial membership setup a year ago. The class options are great and the instructors are equally great.",

Greatly appreciated that I wasn't approached by any PTs for \"work out tips\" to push for packages.\n\nThe bathroom is well maintained & spacious! As a woman who does not like lugging around excess items in her purse... I AM saying THANK YOU for providing a hair straightener / curler for our use\n\nI will be back",

Whether the move was challenging or not, she was there not only as a guide but support. There was acceptance of all levels of fitness and made it fun as well with the great music. It's that good kind of torture lol! Im feeling it the second day but I am signing up for my second class because of her!",
            "I started talking class when the studio first opened and was immediately hooked. Class is continually challenging but I've never felt stronger and more confident! (Mentally and physically). Not to mention - Laurie has created a community of instructors and clients that support each other in equal measure.\n\nDo not feel like you need to have any baseline of strength to start- it's going to be hard and you're going to be sore either way. Trust. My advice is to take the leap and make sure you drink water and stretch A LOT. And then you'll be hooked too! :)",
            "Thank you so much!!!! You are awesome!",
            "I figured that any gym that can get me to a class before noon on a Sunday deserves a five star review. This studio is fantastic, and has actually gotten me excited about working out after years of relative inactivity. I live right around the corner and after months of walking by, decided to try the 2 class intro pass for $32 (2 classes for the price of 1). I basically hadn't worked out beyond some yoga and a classpass here or there in almost a year, so needless to say I was nervous walking into my first class.\n\nFor your first class, they are super welcoming and make sure you choose a megaformer in the middle so you have lots of points of reference and they can keep checking in with you. They usually do a demo as well so you learn a bit about proper form. Each exercise is also cued beforehand so you know where to go and can get there quickly. After your first two classes there's another special for three, so I did that, and by then I was totally addicted. I'm on class 10 or so now and there's still a lot I don't know, but I never feel embarrassed or behind because the instructors are SO encouraging, patient, and positive.\n\nThere's a few moves that my muscles just don't seem to show up for yet (ahem, looking at you obliques...) and they are really good about pushing you and giving modifications when needed. The class is HARD from minute 1 to minute 49, but it's low impact and while your muscles are shaking, I don't ever feel pain or totally out of breath. After my first class I was so sore I could barely walk up and down stairs, but at the advice of the instructors I went back after two days and the workout made me feel a million times better. I still feel sore after each class, just not like the first one (thank god!) After ten classes, I've noticed a major difference in my arms, core, butt, and legs, and I even took a two week hiatus around the holidays.\n\nFor the first few classes I stuck with Laurie and Eileen, because I had such positive experiences with them, but now I've branched out and taken other classes with Laura and Brent and they were equally awesome. Each instructor has their own style and music and I've thoroughly felt good every time I leave a class. You will be holding a lunge, muscles burning, butt twitching, and yet somehow laughing at the instructors' jokes and overall positivity.\n\nYes, it is pricey if you pay per class and want to go a few times a week, but Lagree and other Pilates classes are always going to be expensive. After paying for monthly gym memberships I never used, I'd rather pay for something so motivational that works. I recently got a monthly membership that makes each class a bit cheaper and I'm happy I did.\n\nAlso, they have fun specials, contests, and promotions and they use the MINDBODY app so it's super easy to book classes and check the schedule.\n\nIf you're like me and reading yelp reviews, trying to find a workout class you'll enjoy, please take my advice and sign up!",

            "To say this is my happy place is an understatement.\nI am absolutely obsessed!!! I had gotten to a point in my life where I really liked working out but Lagree makes me love it. It challenges me in so many ways and I leave feeling like I really did something effective (and earned a little cheat!). The proof is visible: you'll see your muscles shaking while on the megaformer, you'll endlessly sweat, and you'll love the changes you notice in your body. The workout itself is intense--the megaformer might overwhelm you at first-- and it's definitely not easy-- but you'd be surprised what your body can handle. Like the amazing, empowering trainers say, it doesn't get easier-- you just become more accustomed and comfortable. Laurie, the owner, is a sweetheart who truly cares about her clients and it really is like a family. I've never taken a class with her or any trainer and been disappointed. Since starting this workout, I've noticed a change not only in my body (I never had a butt honestly) but also in my strength. Clearly, I have endless things to say so I'm gonna wrap it up with if you're looking for something new, fun, and challenging as well as results, you should try it",

Laurie, the owner, is a sweetheart who truly cares about her clients and it really is like a family. I've never taken a class with her or any trainer and been disappointed. Since starting this workout, I've noticed a change not only in my body (I never had a butt honestly) but also in my strength. Clearly, I have endless things to say so I'm gonna wrap it up with if you're looking for something new, fun, and challenging as well as results, you should try it",
            "Thank you so so much! You are amazing and we love having you in class!"

            "Where all all the barre enthusiasts? NYC is open and positivity rates are at a low.\nAs we all know, vax card required to work out and masks are optional. This studio is intimate, clean, sunny with wide window street views. Staff is super friendly and helpful, instruction is precise and detailed with passion and enthusiasm. This one hour barre class will have you shaking, while you are toning and sculpting your muscles to great music. For now, there are weekly eve classes and Saturday AM classes, so come on, put those grippy sox on and join me in the Nomad studio!!!!\nYour body will thank you!",
            "PLEASE HIRE A CLEANER.\n\nThe bathrooms are just not clean. The floor is not cleaned often enough. The mats are not well wiped after class by people.\n\nComparing to other barre classes, this place is a cheaper but definitely needs more improvement.\n\nThe classes are okay - not hard. It's more for barre beginners. There are too much stretching in between so it's like you almost felt the burn and then it's stretching time.",
            "EVERYTHING BURNSSS! You know that feeling when you work out your abs (for me my non-abs), its like that but for the whole body. I have heard of Barre before from a friend who is a professional dancer. I should have known it would be tough when she even described it as difficult. However, I was intrigued so I gave pop physique a try --especially since they have a free class for new clients special right now.\n\nThe studio is very girly, everything is pink and princess-like. Before class began I got a quick tour and was asked to grab an exercise ball, a light weight and a heavy weight. I saw people grabbing 1lb for light weight and 3lb for heavy weight and knew a challenge is coming my way! And sure enough, by the end of class my legs and arms were shaking. The exercise is a mix of ballet, pilates and yoga movements. Everything includes pulses (Like little squat pulses or little plie pulses) which makes the exercise feel like torture.\n\nEven though the class was an hour long it felt longer, mostly because I was struggling but also because the instructor did so many different exercises. It definitely was not a boring class. I do have to say though that I wish classes were split into difficulty. I felt like half the class were beginners and the other were usual clients. It would be nice to have a class that goes over the position of the movements to ensure that everyone is doing it correctly rather than just go-go-go. Another thing was I couldn't hear the instructor too well over the music. I did feel a little lost a times because she talked so fast and did not demonstrate.\n\nOverall, I suggest giving this class a try if you are looking for something to tone your muscles and a good fat burning session. You will MOST DEFINITELY feel it.",
            "This was my first barre class ever and I loved it! It was very intense for me as I am the typical couch potato, but the instructors gave me modifications and helped me push through.\nTIP: Their phone lines no longer work. Everything is digital. Use their live chat on their website for help or their email. Live chat is quicker than email.",
            "I have tried most barre studios in New York and most recently found Pop. The studio on Bowery is so cute -- I am a huge fan of the fruit wallpaper.\n\nSome thing I really enjoy about the workout at Pop Physique is the killer arm series. I find this part of class to be more difficult and longer than most other studios. The first time I went I thought the 1lb weight was pretty lame-- then I understood. Ouch! I also really enjoy the use of a strap for ab work under the bar, it feels very Pilates inspired which I love.\n\nI will say I do really miss carpet at Pop Physique, I don't like how I'm often half on half off the mat during the plank series. My other two cents would be the tempo of the class is a little quick, wish we would stay in thigh and seat and the stretches longer.\n\nI'll be back Pop, thanks!",
            "The new Pop Physique location on Bowery is great! I've only taken one Pop Physique class before at their other location in Nomad on 26th and didn't really remember it being the best barre class I've taken. Now that I've taken barre classes at various studios in the city (given all barre classes are so different), this class was better than I expected! I really enjoyed it.\n\nStudio decor is beautiful and similar to the other location, but I feel this new location it a bit more spacious and nicer in design.\n\nThe instructor (Elyse I believe her name was) was very helpful and constructive! She ran the class very well and everyone was engaged.\n\nSo glad I decided to try out this new studio. I'll definitely be back to this location and probably try out the other location again too! Highly recommend!",

It definitely was not a boring class. I do have to say though that I wish classes were split into difficulty. I felt like half the class were beginners and the other were usual clients. It would be nice to have a class that goes over the position of the movements to ensure that everyone is doing it correctly rather than just go-go-go. Another thing was I couldn't hear the instructor too well over the music. I did feel a little lost a times because she talked so fast and did not demonstrate.\n\nOverall, I suggest giving this class a try if you are looking for something to tone your muscles and a good fat burning session. You will MOST DEFINITELY feel it.",
            "This was my first barre class ever and I loved it! It was very intense for me as I am the typical couch potato, but the instructors gave me modifications and helped me push through.\nTIP: Their phone lines no longer work. Everything is digital. Use their live chat on their website for help or their email. Live chat is quicker than email.",
            "I have tried most barre studios in New York and most recently found Pop. The studio on Bowery is so cute -- I am a huge fan of the fruit wallpaper.\n\nSome thing I really enjoy about the workout at Pop Physique is the killer arm series. I find this part of class to be more difficult and longer than most other studios. The first time I went I thought the 1lb weight was pretty lame-- then I understood. Ouch! I also really enjoy the use of a strap for ab work under the bar, it feels very Pilates inspired which I love.\n\nI will say I do really miss carpet at Pop Physique, I don't like how I'm often half on half off the mat during the plank series. My other two cents would be the tempo of the class is a little quick, wish we would stay in thigh and seat and the stretches longer.\n\nI'll be back Pop, thanks!",
            "The new Pop Physique location on Bowery is great! I've only taken one Pop Physique class before at their other location in Nomad on 26th and didn't really remember it being the best barre class I've taken. Now that I've taken barre classes at various studios in the city (given all barre classes are so different), this class was better than I expected! I really enjoyed it.\n\nStudio decor is beautiful and similar to the other location, but I feel this new location it a bit more spacious and nicer in design.\n\nThe instructor (Elyse I believe her name was) was very helpful and constructive! She ran the class very well and everyone was engaged.\n\nSo glad I decided to try out this new studio. I'll definitely be back to this location and probably try out the other location again too! Highly recommend!",
            "Where all all the barre enthusiasts? NYC is open and positivity rates are at a low.\nAs we all know, vax card required to work out and masks are optional. This studio is intimate, clean, sunny with wide window street views. Staff is super friendly and helpful, instruction is precise and detailed with passion and enthusiasm. This one hour barre class will have you shaking, while you are toning and sculpting your muscles to great music. For now, there are weekly eve classes and Saturday AM classes, so come on, put those grippy sox on and join me in the Nomad studio!!!!\nYour body will thank you!",
            "PLEASE HIRE A CLEANER.\n\nThe bathrooms are just not clean. The floor is not cleaned often enough. The mats are not well wiped after class by people.\n\nComparing to other barre classes, this place is a cheaper but definitely needs more improvement.\n\nThe classes are okay - not hard. It's more for barre beginners. There are too much stretching in between so it's like you almost felt the burn and then it's stretching time.",
            "EVERYTHING BURNSSS! You know that feeling when you work out your abs (for me my non-abs), its like that but for the whole body. I have heard of Barre before from a friend who is a professional dancer. I should have known it would be tough when she even described it as difficult. However, I was intrigued so I gave pop physique a try --especially since they have a free class for new clients special right now.\n\nThe studio is very girly, everything is pink and princess-like. Before class began I got a quick tour and was asked to grab an exercise ball, a light weight and a heavy weight. I saw people grabbing 1lb for light weight and 3lb for heavy weight and knew a challenge is coming my way! And sure enough, by the end of class my legs and arms were shaking. The exercise is a mix of ballet, pilates and yoga movements. Everything includes pulses (Like little squat pulses or little plie pulses) which makes the exercise feel like torture.\n\nEven though the class was an hour long it felt longer, mostly because I was struggling but also because the instructor did so many different exercises.

            "Wow, I really liked this place precovid. Unfortunately, the Dodge Y has become an absolutely awful place. I finally went back for the first time since Covid and the place is a shell of itself.\n\nFirst: they took away towel service. There are no towels at any YMCA locations anymore. No amount of wipes are going to clean the extra perspiration dripping off people and from what I noticed, very few people had their own towels, and I find this to be highly unsanitary! I wouldn't mind bringing my own towel if this was a barebones gym that cost $25 a month but my current monthly expense that accesses all the YMCAs in the area was (notice I said was) $114/month, if you want to join just the Dodge Y it's still $84/month. All of that money and you can't provide towel service???? That brings up problem number two!\n\nThe Dodge Y is not helping out the return to normalcy, their hours are absolutely atrocious! This may come as a shock but lots of people are going back to the office and your 6:00 am to 9:00 pm hours don't cut it, and on weekends...forget about getting up early and getting to the gym first thing in the morning. The Dodge Y has decided that the hours of 8:00 am to 5:00 pm is all you need. Once again, what am I (was I) paying all of this money for?\n\nIt's a shame I have to write this review but they have done it to themselves. Raised prices, taken away hours and services to the point where I had to cancel my membership. There is no way I can justify all of that money per month! There are so many other options that are both high end and barebones. Within 400 feet of the Dodge Y is a Blink Fitness and a Planet fitness. These gyms are basic, you may have to bring your own towel but both of these places offer proper gym hours of 5:00 am to 11:00 pm on weekdays and 7:00 am to 7:00 pm on the weekends. You can also be member of these gyms for $25 to $30 per month and with that savings you can use that money to put towards classes at Orange Theory, F45 or the soon to be open Barry's on Montague street. There are also some high end options in the area like Equinox or Chelsea piers if you'd like to go that route.\n\nIt is a shame that I had to cancel, if they bring back towel service and normal gym hours I'd come back. However, If you're looking for a gym in the Brooklyn Heights, Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Downtown Brooklyn area YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THE DODGE Y UNTIL THEY GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER!\n\nFix it Dodge and I'll be back!",
            "This branch has gone down hill since the pandemic. They had to be pushed to open their gym past 3pm on weekends. Unreliable lifeguards and staff. As I write this no swimming available this Saturday afternoon.. Also, no reason for the steam room and sauna to be closed. Nothing to study, let people assess their own risk. Totally behind the eight ball in all aspects of the pandemic response. Awful. Move on.",
            "This gym is too small for how many members there are. No matter what time of the day you come, it's packed to the brim. I have been here at 7am-7pm and every single time I'm here I have to wait in line for machines or there are giant groups of 12 year old boys having a meet and greet. Besides that, every single lady in the locker room makes laps around the entire room completely naked. I leave the gym in a worse mood then when I entered. It's absolutely miserable.",
            "I enjoy this facility. It is always kept clean and the staff is very courteous. Any issues are quickly resolved. Good job everyone!!",
            "Courteous, young, upbeat staff eager to assist. The Zumba classes are popular. In the summer Zumba moves outdoors and it is free to the public every Sunday in Brooklyn Bridge Park which is a hop, skip, and a jump down Atlantic Avenue.\n\nThe cardio machines, treadmills, and spin bikes work with your choice of the Fox, CNN, or those housewives of wherever. Multiple machines are available. This is one of the few YMCA in Brooklyn that offer towel service free to all members.\n\nInstructional Swim on Saturdays are popular among young families in the area. Lap swim and family swim is also available to all members Blink and Planet Fitesse are within walking distance, but they can not compete with the pool or the group exercise classes like palates, yoga, and spin. I'm impressed by the ladies lockeroom on the 2nd floor, because an attendant is always present to keep it clean and the locker rooms are clean and comfortable.\n\nDiscounted memberships are available to municipal employees and those in need of financial assistance.\n\nFour stars because there is a waiting list to rent a locker on a monthly basis.\n\nBut when I walk in I feel a sense of community as I see friends and neighbors take advantage of the services provided by one if the oldest non profit organization in the the country.\n\nI love it here.",

It is so spacious, modern, clean....has all the equipment, space, full basketball court, 6 lane 25m swimming pool, at the best price. Equinox and Chelsea Piers is no comparison (visited all of them). This combined with friendly staff, members and all they do for the community makes them hands down the best gym in the neighborhood.",
            "Even though the customer service here can be inconsistent, overall I am a fan and am glad that this is available right in my neighborhood. I take a lot of the group exercise classes, and though the teachers and offerings don't change very often, I've found the 2-3 weekly classes that I do like to attend.\n\nThe pool is a great resource, but as others have noted, it can be overwhelming to determine the optimal time to go if you are adult wanting to swim laps.\n\nIn general the younger check in and other staff are eager, pleasant, and willing to help - but there are some very attitudinal long timers at the membership desk who I actively avoid if I have an issue.\n\nOverall for the comparative price to an Equinox or Chelsea Piers type facility I believe you get value for your money here, and a great community environment.",
            "I have been to this gym multiple times as a guest ($20 each time) in over 2 years, prior covid. Prior to covid, the gym itself isn't too spacious but you will get everything you need done. With covid, I can't imagine it has space for distancing. When i was a guest there, I mainly use the swimming pool for an hour accompanied by some weight machines. Since their reopening after covid, they have not allowed guests and that is understandable. They make you buy the membership which is also understandable. But for someone like me with swimming as a priority, the Y App is complete useless and a lie when it comes to scheduling for my lap swims. First of all, they only let 6 people in, every 30 minutes (used to be 45min). You go on the app and join one of the 6 spots 48 hours before going. However, with multiple experimental attempts trying to schedule, the slots get filled instantly as soon as they allow you to reserve. So let say I want to go at 8am lap swim on Wed, I must reserve a spot on Monday exactly at 8am, not a second less/more. As soon as the clock turns 8:00, all the spots have been fill. I do not know why or how, but I have tried this multiple times. You may think if you join the waitlist, you will get a spot once a spot opens up. NOPE! it doesn't. Once you get an email notifying you with an opening, the spot has been taken by someone else. There is simply no way to reserve a spot. Therefore, if you are like me, wishing to use the swimming pool (more than the other things), find another gyms. I also got no reply from the Y's customer service when I emailed them about this.

The coach was super nice and knowledgeable and even at the start of the class, offered to help set me up. The class was a good size where I didn't feel I was just another number and the coach was able to correct forms and give pointers throughout the workout. I will say, the class is pretty fast-paced and it will work muscles you never knew you had.\n\n\nService / Amenities:\n- As soon as I walked in to check in, the front desk crew was super nice and showed me around. I really liked how attentive and friendly they were! And even at the end of the class, they gave a goodie bag.\n- The space is really clean, the lockers are a great size, and the best part, is they have a whole shared space with dry shampoo, deodorant, a blow dryer, and some face products",
            "Modern and chic- this place is fabulous. Music wasn't too loud, it was uplifting and energetic. I took a Sculpt & Progressive Weight Training class with Melanie. She is a great instructor, she comes around to every one in the room and provide pointers and corrects our form. Her voice is amplified with the headset she has on, it's not too loud nor not too quiet. Everyone is totally focused on themselves, so if you have anxiety like me- it's not too worrisome! Bathrooms are clean, no need to bring locks as it's already pre-installed. I suggest to come in already dressed and to pack light. The lockers are really small!

The staff is great and helpful. Checkin process is seamless and there's a lot of area to hang out before the studio.\n\nNow onto the bad. I find that the workout is just not good. It's just hard enough that I don't feel the same \"zen\" that I get from yoga or Pilates, but not hard enough where I feel like I'm getting an actual workout. I also think it's a little confusing for a first timer- it wasn't completely clear to me how to interpret the instructor's directions with the numbered mat. I feel like this could be rectified very easily with 2-3 minutes of directions before class. Same thing with the equipment - they use basically resistance bands with Velcro ankle straps that were a little confusing during my first class.\n\nMy main complaint is that all of the equipment is set up pre-class and the last class I took, there was a huge open space in the middle of the room but the mats were really close to each other and the woman next to me (no fault of hers) kicked me a couple times before I got fed up and moved my mat a foot further into the empty space. It just seemed weird that they wouldn't have thought of that before class?\n\nAnyway, I would maybe try one more just because the studio is SO nice, but of the workouts I've tried in New York it's in my bottom three.",

            "I used to train my clients here from 2019-2020. I purchased a 10 pack of sessions in March 2020 and the gym closed less than a couple weeks later due to COVID. I reached out to the owner (David/Dave) multiple times through email, text, and phone call about a refund for my unused sessions since the gym was not in use. He never responded to me. I moved out of state in the summer and knew FOR SURE I would not use the sessions so I reached out again because I needed the money and no response again! I received an email when the franchise reopened in October, yet again, I reached out about a refund and no one got back to me. EXTREMELY POOR management on the owner's part. I will never recommend a place that does not take care of the people (the independent trainers) making them money.",
            "What a great gym in a great spot! Clean and has EVERYTHING you could ever want. I love to do strength training and also some conditioning and this place has it all and is actually CLEAN. Will be back for sure :)"

I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the neighborhood looking for tailored workouts.\n\nMy goal was to rebuild my core strength and balance after having a baby. I work with Brad, who is super cool and knowledgable (and has great taste in music to boot). The Greys team has been really accommodating with my schedule and have made it fun and easy to get back in the swing of regular workouts. I can already feel the difference after 10 sessions."

Orientation was supposed to start at a certain time, but we didn't actually start until 15-20m later due to her not having the room ready, and that cut into the class time we paid admission for.\n\nEven worse, she didn't perform a proper safety check of the room before class. There were standing metal items in the room that could have fallen on guests. In fact, right in the middle of class, something fell on top of one of the participants while they were in the middle of a yoga pose. Fortunately they were ok but it could have been a lot worse.\n\nOverall a negative experience and instead I would recommend any of the thousands of great yoga studios around NYC."

            "0 stars. Our home club was closed and we were invited to try other clubs. The people at the front desk were so badly misinformed and made us feel so stupid when we told them the situation. We even had an email coming from both the official Equinox account and our home club's general manager. After a long back and forth, the front desk finally called their supervisor, who also made us feel like we were in the wrong. This is the only club that gave us any trouble this closure week because they were clearly not paying attention to announcements and gave so much attitude. With a club that has such a low rating, you would think that customer service would at least be decent.",

Nothing except they keep expanding into different locations that have nothing to do with your gym. It's always way too crowded to have an effective work out, there are left over shavers in the showers, they dilute their khiels products with water. The people who work here are super nice and the gym itself is in good shape, just corporate is making being a member a miserable and grifting experience.",

At this point, they are making up terms that don't exist in the agreement to try to force me to stay a member and not cancel, which is truly pathetic.\n\nAdditionally, their trainers are rude. They will take their clients and work out uncomfortably close to you, even when there is plenty of space in the gym, and then expect you to move even if you were there first.\n\nI'm pretty sure the people that work here are soulless zombies and my life would have been better off if I had never signed up.\n\nLastly, this location is really busy and some days it's impossible to use any equipment without waiting a long time.",

            "There was an incident at the club on July 31st where my privacy was violated and I felt insecure. I brought this issue to the attention of the manager, Merrick Schmidt. However, instead of making me feel secure and dealing with the privacy concern that I raised, he turned the whole thing around and tried to make me the culprit. Let me please explain. Some random guy started to film - take pictures on the fourth floor of the gym. I approached this person and asked him to please not take any photos or videos of me. He mumbled something and continued to film and take pictures. I then walked back, got my phone and took a picture of him. I then got my belongings, took the elevator down and went into the manager's office, which was the coat closet at the time. I told the manager what had happened and showed him the picture of the person that was taking pictures and filming on the fourth floor. I told the manager that I have never seen this person at the gym before. The manager told me that he has never seen him before as well. I then asked the manager whether or not he could find who this person was in the checkin files on the computer. I also asked the manager whether or not he was a member and whether or not he was allowed to be in the gym. The manager told me that he might not even be in those files. The manager then told me that he was going to go up stairs and try to find this person. However, I needed to delete the picture I had taken of this person before he could do that. I told the manager that 1) I do not know who this person is. 2) You do not know who this person is. 3) You just told me that this person might not be in the checkin files so he might not even be allowed to be here 4) This person might have walked out, either through the front door OR through the fire exit before I got down to your office. So I told the manager that I was not going to delete the picture until he actually found this person because the picture I had taken might be the only picture of this person we have.

            "There was an incident at the club on July 31st where my privacy was violated and I felt insecure. I brought this issue to the attention of the manager, Merrick Schmidt. However, instead of making me feel secure and dealing with the privacy concern that I raised, he turned the whole thing around and tried to make me the culprit. Let me please explain. Some random guy started to film - take pictures on the fourth floor of the gym. I approached this person and asked him to please not take any photos or videos of me. He mumbled something and continued to film and take pictures. I then walked back, got my phone and took a picture of him. I then got my belongings, took the elevator down and went into the manager's office, which was the coat closet at the time. I told the manager what had happened and showed him the picture of the person that was taking pictures and filming on the fourth floor. I told the manager that I have never seen this person at the gym before. The manager told me that he has never seen him before as well. I then asked the manager whether or not he could find who this person was in the checkin files on the computer. I also asked the manager whether or not he was a member and whether or not he was allowed to be in the gym. The manager told me that he might not even be in those files. The manager then told me that he was going to go up stairs and try to find this person. However, I needed to delete the picture I had taken of this person before he could do that. I told the manager that 1) I do not know who this person is. 2) You do not know who this person is. 3) You just told me that this person might not be in the checkin files so he might not even be allowed to be here 4) This person might have walked out, either through the front door OR through the fire exit before I got down to your office. So I told the manager that I was not going to delete the picture until he actually found this person because the picture I had taken might be the only picture of this person we have. After that, the manager got very indecent with me and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I first offered to hand over my phone to him, but he said that I might have sent the picture to the cloud!

            "There was an incident at the club on July 31st where my privacy was violated and I felt insecure. I brought this issue to the attention of the manager, Merrick Schmidt. However, instead of making me feel secure and dealing with the privacy concern that I raised, he turned the whole thing around and tried to make me the culprit. Let me please explain. Some random guy started to film - take pictures on the fourth floor of the gym. I approached this person and asked him to please not take any photos or videos of me. He mumbled something and continued to film and take pictures. I then walked back, got my phone and took a picture of him. I then got my belongings, took the elevator down and went into the manager's office, which was the coat closet at the time. I told the manager what had happened and showed him the picture of the person that was taking pictures and filming on the fourth floor. I told the manager that I have never seen this person at the gym before. The manager told me that he has never seen him before as well. I then asked the manager whether or not he could find who this person was in the checkin files on the computer. I also asked the manager whether or not he was a member and whether or not he was allowed to be in the gym. The manager told me that he might not even be in those files. The manager then told me that he was going to go up stairs and try to find this person. However, I needed to delete the picture I had taken of this person before he could do that. I told the manager that 1) I do not know who this person is. 2) You do not know who this person is. 3) You just told me that this person might not be in the checkin files so he might not even be allowed to be here 4) This person might have walked out, either through the front door OR through the fire exit before I got down to your office. So I told the manager that I was not going to delete the picture until he actually found this person because the picture I had taken might be the only picture of this person we have. After that, the manager got very indecent with me and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I first offered to hand over my phone to him, but he said that I might have sent the picture to the cloud! What? Then I offered to unlock my phone and hand it over to him so he could delete the picture if he actually found this person upstairs. After that, he got even nastier with me. He started to wave his fingers at me and told me that this was very unsettling. He then told me that he and I would be having a conversation about my membership when he came back! (I am sure that he would have waved his fingers at Anderson Cooper and told him that he was going to have a conversation about his membership if he was in this situation instead of me! I am sure of it!) Long story short, I switched my membership to a different level because I no longer wanted to go back to the gym that he \"managed.\" However, I continued to receive emails from the Greenwich Ave. location signed by this so called manager, about the service updates and renovations, although I no longer had access to that location. This was after I told Merrick Schmidt over email to please stop sending me emails not once but twice. (If you tell someone to stop sending you emails twice and if they continue to do so then it constitutes harassment.) I even gave a copy of my state id and provided snail mail that had my address on to a representative at a different location so that they could make that location my home gym. However, the emails from Greenwich Ave. signed by Merrick Schmidt did not stop, even two months after I had no access to the Greenwich Ave. location. I then basically cancelled my membership two months later. Therefore, go to this gym if you want to be yelled at when you are right and then later be harassed.",

            "I have been a member of Base at 60 Christopher Columbus Drive for almost 8 years now, ever since I moved to lovely downtown Jersey City, NJ. Joining this stellar gym is one of my best choices while living in Jersey City. Owner Craig puts a great deal of time and effort into keeping Base a fully equipped exceptional gym. It is always.super clean, with quality workout equipment and classes. It is 2 glorious floors. The locker rooms are clean and contain showers and steam rooms. A special commendation to the personable staff of Erin, Silvia, Mayrin, Vika, Carolina, Andrew, Tianna, and trainers Igor, James and Ubei, among others. I give this gym the highest recommendation possible, as well as it being 1/2 block from the PATH trains.",
            "June 5, 2022 - I have been a Base member for 7 years. One of the best decisions I ever made when moving to glorious downtown Jersey City. Base is centrally located on Christopher Columbus Drive and right near the PATH trains. The gym itself is always super clean with a nice variety of equipment and space to be able to work out. Owner Craig makes sure to consistently upgrade equipment and decor to make it more inviting to patrons. Craig's got a stellar supporting team in Erin, Silvia, Vica, Ashley, and great trainers in Igor, James and Ubei, to name just a few. I am proud to be a part of this top notch gym.",
            "Base is one incredible gym and I am lucky it is very close to where I live. Owner Craig takes great pride in Base--the cleanliness, decor, equipment and incredible staff. I am happy to say business looks like it's picking up at this point in the pandemic. Base practices facial mask usage, social distancing of equipment, and having disinfectant sprays and towelettes available to keep equipment clean. A special shout-out to the amazing team of Marrin, Vika, trainers Igor, James and Greg, and highly personable sales people Erin and Silvia. As Downtown Jersey City continues to blossom, so I hope Base's membership will continue to as well.",
            "Base Gym New Jersey at 60 Christopher Columbus Drive has reopened for indoor activities a few days ago and I could not wait to get back to my routine workouts. I was extremely impressed with owner Craig's attention to thoroughly following CDC guidelines--temperature check, signing a Covid-19 form, social distancing signs on equipment and loads of disinfectants and sanitizers throughout the gym. I saw much of the staff as of a few months ago and newbie Vika who diligently helped me download the Base App. I am happy to be back and I know all comers were ecstatic as well. I give Base Gym the highest of recommendations.",
            "Base is one wonderful health club. I have been coming to Base for almost 4 years. It is located in the great downtown Jersey City hub at 60 Christopher Columbus Drive, where new buildings are sprouting. Base constantly updates and beautifies itself. The workout equipment is top of the line and it offers yoga and many other group classes. The client base is a nice mix of people. Special commendation to owner Craig, and staff members Kara, Merryn, Cesar, Erin, Igor, Greg, Ashley, and Drew. Their customer interaction skills are warm and inviting.",
            "I have been a member of Base Gym for almost 3 years. Not only is it convenient for me to get to, but it is a superior well-equipped gym. Base contains modern equipment situated wonderfully on its lower and upper floors. The staff is personable and courteous--and very friendly too. I know the names of most of the staff. Owner Craig is a super guy who takes much pride in the appearance and functionality of the gym. Staff of Kara, Cesar, Erin, Igor, Ashley, among others, make me feel so welcomed whenever I work out. And the clientele is varied and into achieving their daily gym routines. I love Base and highly recommend it to others.",
            "Good gym with lots of options. Definitely has the gym culture/community. The front desk workers are always kind. I've only gone for weightlifting and cardio machines but they do have classes which is cool. Better than other commercial gyms I've gone to. It is a pricy membership with a hefty activation fee but brings a good crowd of people. Right in downtown JC near the path train and grove/newark area. Be aware: very crowded.",
            "I'm from Cali and a member of 24 hour fitness which there is a ton of locations everywhere, but since moving east 24 hour isn't popular so I had to find a new home. I tried other gyms and Base has been the best. I recently joined a month ago and loved how it reminds me of Equinox (I been a member there too) but less stuffy crowd. A lot of weights and cardio equipment even when busy I don't feel like I have to wait there's always another option. I love the fitness classes just wish they had cycle. I was told they just removed it due to low attendance which is a bummer I'm a cycle girlie. They keep the gym super clean and staff is friendly. The locker rooms have saunas inside and are separated by each genders locker which makes it comfortable due to clothing restrictions (wear a towel around you) and the showers are nice. I also love the smoothie shop attached! Happy I found a great gym to train at. It's pricy but worth it if you want access to a ton of equipment, classes, and amenities. Overall clean environment.",
            "Best gym ever staff is very friendly clean love this place\nIt has every machine possible!!",
            "Love their classes. Certainly the nicest gym in jersey city and the staff are so friendly. It gets overly crowded after work though.",
            "I love this gym and train with Igor Fernandes who is the absolute best! This place is huge with incredible ceiling height and giant windows that fill the space with tons of natural light, it's a bright, energetic and motivating place. The staff is super helpful, the equipment is new and the sauna/steam room are clean and perfect after a hard workout. Second to none.",
            "I've been a member ever since they opened and I truly love this place. Bright, airy interior, lots of new equipment, non-stop classes daily (pre-Covid) and virtual ones available now. Love the staff, the location and the validated parking. For me, it is the only gym in town!",

I've only gone for weightlifting and cardio machines but they do have classes which is cool. Better than other commercial gyms I've gone to.

A lot of weights and cardio equipment even when busy I don't feel like I have to wait there's always another option. I love the fitness classes just wish they had cycle. I was told they just removed it due to low attendance which is a bummer I'm a cycle girlie. They keep the gym super clean and staff is friendly. The locker rooms have saunas inside and are separated by each genders locker which makes it comfortable due to clothing restrictions (wear a towel around you) and the showers are nice.

            "Best gym ever staff is very friendly clean love this place\nIt has every machine possible!!",
            "Love their classes. Certainly the nicest gym in jersey city and the staff are so friendly. It gets overly crowded after work though.",
            "I love this gym and train with Igor Fernandes who is the absolute best! This place is huge with incredible ceiling height and giant windows that fill the space with tons of natural light, it's a bright, energetic and motivating place. The staff is super helpful, the equipment is new and the sauna/steam room are clean and perfect after a hard workout. Second to none.",
            "I've been a member ever since they opened and I truly love this place. Bright, airy interior, lots of new equipment, non-stop classes daily (pre-Covid) and virtual ones available now. Love the staff, the location and the validated parking. For me, it is the only gym in town!",
            "I have been a member of Base at 60 Christopher Columbus Drive for almost 8 years now, ever since I moved to lovely downtown Jersey City, NJ. Joining this stellar gym is one of my best choices while living in Jersey City. Owner Craig puts a great deal of time and effort into keeping Base a fully equipped exceptional gym. It is always.super clean, with quality workout equipment and classes. It is 2 glorious floors. The locker rooms are clean and contain showers and steam rooms. A special commendation to the personable staff of Erin, Silvia, Mayrin, Vika, Carolina, Andrew, Tianna, and trainers Igor, James and Ubei, among others. I give this gym the highest recommendation possible, as well as it being 1/2 block from the PATH trains.",
            "June 5, 2022 - I have been a Base member for 7 years. One of the best decisions I ever made when moving to glorious downtown Jersey City. Base is centrally located on Christopher Columbus Drive and right near the PATH trains. The gym itself is always super clean with a nice variety of equipment and space to be able to work out. Owner Craig makes sure to consistently upgrade equipment and decor to make it more inviting to patrons. Craig's got a stellar supporting team in Erin, Silvia, Vica, Ashley, and great trainers in Igor, James and Ubei, to name just a few. I am proud to be a part of this top notch gym.",
            "Base is one incredible gym and I am lucky it is very close to where I live. Owner Craig takes great pride in Base--the cleanliness, decor, equipment and incredible staff. I am happy to say business looks like it's picking up at this point in the pandemic. Base practices facial mask usage, social distancing of equipment, and having disinfectant sprays and towelettes available to keep equipment clean. A special shout-out to the amazing team of Marrin, Vika, trainers Igor, James and Greg, and highly personable sales people Erin and Silvia. As Downtown Jersey City continues to blossom, so I hope Base's membership will continue to as well.",
            "Base Gym New Jersey at 60 Christopher Columbus Drive has reopened for indoor activities a few days ago and I could not wait to get back to my routine workouts. I was extremely impressed with owner Craig's attention to thoroughly following CDC guidelines--temperature check, signing a Covid-19 form, social distancing signs on equipment and loads of disinfectants and sanitizers throughout the gym. I saw much of the staff as of a few months ago and newbie Vika who diligently helped me download the Base App. I am happy to be back and I know all comers were ecstatic as well. I give Base Gym the highest of recommendations.",
            "Base is one wonderful health club. I have been coming to Base for almost 4 years. It is located in the great downtown Jersey City hub at 60 Christopher Columbus Drive, where new buildings are sprouting. Base constantly updates and beautifies itself. The workout equipment is top of the line and it offers yoga and many other group classes. The client base is a nice mix of people. Special commendation to owner Craig, and staff members Kara, Merryn, Cesar, Erin, Igor, Greg, Ashley, and Drew. Their customer interaction skills are warm and inviting.",
            "I have been a member of Base Gym for almost 3 years. Not only is it convenient for me to get to, but it is a superior well-equipped gym. Base contains modern equipment situated wonderfully on its lower and upper floors. The staff is personable and courteous--and very friendly too. I know the names of most of the staff. Owner Craig is a super guy who takes much pride in the appearance and functionality of the gym. Staff of Kara, Cesar, Erin, Igor, Ashley, among others, make me feel so welcomed whenever I work out. And the clientele is varied and into achieving their daily gym routines. I love Base and highly recommend it to others.",
            "Good gym with lots of options. Definitely has the gym culture/community. The front desk workers are always kind. I've only gone for weightlifting and cardio machines but they do have classes which is cool. Better than other commercial gyms I've gone to. It is a pricy membership with a hefty activation fee but brings a good crowd of people. Right in downtown JC near the path train and grove/newark area. Be aware: very crowded.",
            "I'm from Cali and a member of 24 hour fitness which there is a ton of locations everywhere, but since moving east 24 hour isn't popular so I had to find a new home. I tried other gyms and Base has been the best. I recently joined a month ago and loved how it reminds me of Equinox (I been a member there too) but less stuffy crowd. A lot of weights and cardio equipment even when busy I don't feel like I have to wait there's always another option. I love the fitness classes just wish they had cycle. I was told they just removed it due to low attendance which is a bummer I'm a cycle girlie. They keep the gym super clean and staff is friendly. The locker rooms have saunas inside and are separated by each genders locker which makes it comfortable due to clothing restrictions (wear a towel around you) and the showers are nice. I also love the smoothie shop attached! Happy I found a great gym to train at. It's pricy but worth it if you want access to a ton of equipment, classes, and amenities. Overall clean environment.",

            "I've only ever visited this location through a guest pass from a friend, so I don't really have a reason to clamor about paying. I will say upfront that I don't think it's worth the price, but that's up for debate.\n\nBased on the amenities, equipment, and environment, everything exudes a classy, premium vibe. In the general reception area, they have a upscale lounge set up where I noticed a lot of people were working from their laptop and chilling around. The other amenities like the pool, views of Hudson River, outdoor sauna unit, make the Hudson Yards location stand out.\n\nI worked out here during a week day around the morning time and it was already feeling full. I don't want to even think about how full this place would be during peak hours. They have a bunch of classes throughout the day, but unfortunately, I didn't really have time to check one of them out.\n\nI'm a simple guy: give me free weights and a bench and I can have a solid workout. At the end of the day, this a very nice gym, but not a practical option for the masses.",
            "This is for the spa: It's so wonderful here. Come here with a friend. Take advantage of the lounge pods with the immaculate view of the water. Ask for a blanket. Get a massage and enjoy the water and hot tea. Then order lunch. My Caesar salad with steak was satisfying. Enjoy the sauna. I love it here.",
            "Love love love this gym! I spent a weekend at the hotel and was sold on joining. Everything is so clean and pretty. The best view when working out makes it so much easier. Having access to a pool in New York is a major plus. The ladies locker room has both a sauna and steam room and there's also a jacuzzi and a cold plunge indoors.\n\nThe daily classes are great and there are so many different options.\nThere are so many amenities to take advantage of, I always feel so relaxed when I leave here.",
            "It is unacceptable to pay $380 for a monthly gym membership and have equipment broken for more than a week.",
            "We paid almost 400 dollars for a gym where it should have the best internet connection and yet it hasn't been like that for over a week and the internet signal hasn't worked properly. I hope they can take some action.",
            "Yes the facilities are nicer than the average Equinox. And you get some nice views of the river and landmarks like the Vessel. But honestly unless you are sitting with your phone signing up for a class 24 hours before a class opens, good luck getting into one. Probably not going to renew - just NOT WORTH the 300 bucks a month or so for Destination when other Equinox locations - and even most luxury high rise buildings have gyms that are pretty good these days.",
            "All I gotta say is WOW.... I was blown away the first time I stepped into this equinox. It has to be the most luxurious gym I've ever been to.\n\nThis gym has everything you could want- my favorite part is the rooftop pool overlooking the vessel and the rest of Hudson yards. It's a breathtaking view. There's a ton of lounge chairs on the other side of the rooftop as well if you want to just relax without getting wet.\n\nThe actual fitness floor is huge and has all the machines and free weights you could ever want. There's a ton of super high tech cardio equipment as well. I do wish they had more stair climbers because 3 isn't enough.\n\nEvery inch of the building from the lobby to the stairs to the locker room has been carefully designed to have that luxury touch. If you workout in the evenings on a sunny day, you can catch a beautiful sunset through the floor to ceiling glass while working out. I feel like this equinox has to be one of the best gyms in the world.",

However, I have yet to receive a response from Oscar Mejia, the assistant general manager. It's clear the gym doesn't care about membership and it's customer service has gone downhill. Very disappointed.",

To my disbelief, the staff's response was nothing short of apathetic and dismissive. Instead of promptly addressing the issue, they callously suggested that my stolen possessions \"might turn up later,\" showing a complete lack of concern for my situation.\n\nDespite paying a $400/month membership fee, I was met with utter indifference from the staff, who not only refused to help me search for my belongings but also failed to offer any viable alternatives, even saying that I should just purchase new shoes from their shop. When I inquired about the possibility of reviewing security footage, they were quick to claim such action was impossible.\n\nThis gym's deplorable staff and their unwillingness to address this issue have left me deeply disillusioned. Such an experience is an outright mockery of the concept of a luxury gym.

            "Beautiful place but very poorly managed. I've been a member since day one since I live 2 blocks away. It would be a nice view of the Vessel if not for filthy windows (I haven't seen window washers in 5 years!). Women's sauna is always in and out of service and when's it working it's burning hot! The outside pool what makes the whole experience is a disaster and it's impossible to get a chair. It's up to 5 hours wait on the weekend so don't even bother... but their quick to raise your membership rate! It's now over $300 for just one location!",
            "***Friendly Service, Clean, Stretching Class Review***\n\nI came here on a guest pass. I was very impressed by how clean the gym is. I enjoyed the towel fridge; that is something I would definitely come back for. Otherwise, it has the standard equipments you can find at most gyms. I also took a stretching class which was very relaxing and I highly recommend.",

I will say upfront that I don't think it's worth the price, but that's up for debate.\n\nBased on the amenities, equipment, and environment, everything exudes a classy, premium vibe. In the general reception area, they have a upscale lounge set up where I noticed a lot of people were working from their laptop and chilling around. The other amenities like the pool, views of Hudson River, outdoor sauna unit, make the Hudson Yards location stand out.\n\nI worked out here during a week day around the morning time and it was already feeling full.

They have a bunch of classes throughout the day, but unfortunately, I didn't really have time to check one of them out.\n\nI'm a simple guy: give me free weights and a bench and I can have a solid workout. At the end of the day, this a very nice gym, but not a practical option for the masses.",
            "This is for the spa: It's so wonderful here. Come here with a friend. Take advantage of the lounge pods with the immaculate view of the water. Ask for a blanket.

            "Love love love this gym! I spent a weekend at the hotel and was sold on joining. Everything is so clean and pretty. The best view when working out makes it so much easier.

            "Yes the facilities are nicer than the average Equinox. And you get some nice views of the river and landmarks like the Vessel. But honestly unless you are sitting with your phone signing up for a class 24 hours before a class opens, good luck getting into one.

It has to be the most luxurious gym I've ever been to.\n\nThis gym has everything you could want- my favorite part is the rooftop pool overlooking the vessel and the rest of Hudson yards. It's a breathtaking view. There's a ton of lounge chairs on the other side of the rooftop as well if you want to just relax without getting wet.\n\nThe actual fitness floor is huge and has all the machines and free weights you could ever want. There's a ton of super high tech cardio equipment as well.

The outside pool what makes the whole experience is a disaster and it's impossible to get a chair.

            "Start your review of Chinatown Branch YMCA",
            "This is a good YMCA. Not the best, not the worst.\n\nThe pool is large and kept fairly warm. The workout area has dated equipment, but there are lots of machines. As far as weights go, there are dumbells, barbells, squat racks, and benches (flat, inclined, and declined).\n\nThe locker room is a bit on the older side. Its a little dirty and sometimes has a strange smell.\n\nPre-COVID they gave out towels, which was a big plus.",
            "If someone says they will take you down to Chinatown like DeNiro did in that silly movie with Stiller, Ben that is, maybe they mean that they'll help you get in shape. But it'll be hard at this gym. And no, I don't mean *that* will be hard. It's honestly not that kind of gym, fam.\n\nThis is a pretty good subterranean Y considering how bad some of the non-Manhattan ones are, but it is lagging behind some of the more corporate and hard-to-access ones in the fancier parts of the island.\n\nParking can be tricky but if you can find some, such as on a Sunday, you can get a decent workout here. Having said that, a lot of the stuff is old and crumbling and falling apart, and space is crazy cramped.\n\nBut the thing is, they're friendly, they're chill, they're falling apart but they make it work, and even though it's probably a 2 or 3 star gym, I actually found it much easier than the so-called 5 star YMCAs in Manhattan to use, because they're not so psycho-restrictive at the front desk.\n\nAs for the question Why MCA? I respond - why not?",
            "DO NOT GO NEAR. Check the Google reviews.\nYou'll see a bunch of reviews where they keep charging your credit card after you cancel.\nThese guys are crooks.",
            "Filthy Locker Room, Management Doesn't Care\n\nHand dryer has been broken in the ladies' locker room for months. I was told that YMCA upper management doesn't allow paper towels in locker rooms, even when the hand dryer is broken. Its hard to simply wash hands at YMCA because there is nowhere to dry them. Showers have had black mold on the curtains in the recent past. No maintenance on the gym floor, the lighter-weight free weights are a jumble. Front desk staff is nice and the other people working out are nice, but the management is unconcerned with hygiene. If there was another near alternative, I'd be working out there. Chinatown deserves a clean Y.",
            "Pool had been 'closed for maintenance' for couple of Saturday afternoons recently. Some areas might have been cleaned, but much more extensive cleaning is needed, particularly near the center lanes. Lots of yucky slime there! Wondering about the bacteria level? Don't see anyone testing water anymore.\nBe careful using lockers. Got fleas! Wondering why unlocked lockers are filled with clothing? Should be inspected and cleaned/fumigated periodically.\nIn all fairness, the activities at this Y is great. Good value for the membership. But pool equipment needs some attention and replacement.",
            "I have been a member of this Y since 2007. The Y, pretty new then, was well maintained and clean. Over the last years, maintenace had gotten progressively worst.\nAs of late, the pool has been pretty gross. Slimy growth has appeared near the center of the pool. Maybe it needs a more extensive clean job? More chorine? Bathroom in the Women's locker room has a broken lock, showers are frequently out, dirty lockers, etc. Hoping improvements, particularly in pool, will be made.",
            "On a warm Sunday afternoon I came here with a few of my Canto friends/teachers for an hour long work out. I ended up only working out for twenty minutes which was all I needed to release my anger and frustration of this past week. We all registered for the one day guest pass which is free.

I ended up only working out for twenty minutes which was all I needed to release my anger and frustration of this past week. We all registered for the one day guest pass which is free. The gym facilities were decent with lockers and showers. However, there were no benches to sit for changing. There were also no hair dryers for women which is okay for me as I always air dry my hair. The equipment is decent although there are some that I have not seen at Crunch Fitness gyms. I don't believe (although I could be wrong) that there were any classes for aerobics, spinning, or any genre of sport held at this location.\n\nI rate it four stars due to lack of staff as it was my first time to use the facilities at any YMCA, which I was hoping a staff can give me a mini tour of the locations for women's changing rooms, lockers, showers, etc.\n\nN.B. Patrons entering the main gym rooms of the double white doors must push down the door handle and pull it open. Otherwise, you'll be struggling to get the double white doors to open, which of course no one informed me. Also, the classrooms do not allow cameras and no photography or videography during presentations are permitted. A hefty bankrupt rental fee is required for space reservation.",
            "I had no idea there was a chinatown ymca here - it is hidden (especially now with the construction going on in the front and back of the building) - but this gem sits right next to whole foods.\n\nApparently, it is not so much of a secret because the gym was in good use on the saturday afternoon we arrived. Lots of kids and a few adults playing basketball in the spacious, bright gym.\n\nAdjacent to the gym was a small dance studio where little kids were running around.\n\nI also got a chance to check out the bathroom, which was clean.\n\nNot sure of the rates to become a member, but I would assume it's like most ymca's",
            "Absolutely worst gym I have ever been too. Don't ever expect to use the pool. The one and only thing i joined. There's a ton of other gyms I can run or lift at. None has a pool.\n\nDo not expect to use the pool. Even if it looks empty nope. It's either over packed. Like seriously overpacked. (I don't know how the life guard does it. Props to them!) or everything is closed off unless you're in a class.\n\nStaff is great and courteous but the whole gym program is terrible. Always helpful and answers and questions you have.\n\nI've been coming here since 2011-2013 and stopped because of this. Joined again earlier this year because of serious health issues and need to exercise. And nothing has changed. This isn't a one time issue.\n\nFunny - when the second time I joined an older guy in the locker room was yelling his head off about similar issues and how this location sucks. How he's been coming to this location for decades and it's just downhill. So yeah I'm not the only one who feels this way.",
            "I'll be honest - I drop into a YMCA in NYC and I'm not expecting much. The Chinatown Branch actually blew me away. Yes, it's fairly small. Yes, the pool is always insanely crowded (if you are a legit swimmer and want to swim laps, I'd recommend finding another place). But it's clean, the staff is friendly, and it's completely adequate for your workout needs - treadmills, step mills, spin bikes, etc. I've only dropped in there when I'm staying in NYC and need a gym, but would way prefer to come here over other gyms in the area (well, in large part due to the free passes online!)."

The good is that you get your own lane. Equinox allows 3 per lane which is why I'll never use it again. BUT I don't like the limitation of an hour. I used to swim for 2-3 hours at Lifetime. I'd come on a weekend morning and it was never an issue. Knowing the limitation ruined this activity for me.\n\nI'm an Equinox member so the luxury of it is okay. It's clean but gets busy fast.

They seem to have the same machines just spread out.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure I'll maintain my Equinox membership because the pandemic showed me that it's not essential to get a workout.

            "Good afternoon, Lillian! First, I'm glad you are enjoying being back in the club - it's always good to reconnect with the community!\n\nNext, I'm sorry that our lap pool policy is not what you prefer; it was put in place in reaction to COVID restrictions. There are ways of extending your swim time - just stop by the Lobby Concierge and we can work something out for you!\n\nHave a great day and hope to see you in the club!",
            "I'm an executive member at Equinox, but live next door to this gym. Their lap pool used to be in my building (The Atelier).\n\nStaff: Very nice people. It's pleasant to see and chat with the staff each visit. 5 stars for them. But this review is about the facility.\n\nLap Pool: When I go, it's usually empty for hours, allowing me a relaxing swim. I enjoy this most.\n\nGym Floor: What can I say as an Equinox member? This is a tough one to be fair. Let's just say that I saw LT at Sky as a supplementary gym that I'd go to when I missed a workout at Equinox or for weekends. Fast forward to an injury. The doc said I can't lift heavy. That changed everything.\n\nAs a bodybuilder who couldn't even lift 10 lbs, I didn't want to be seen at a larger gym. LT became my primary spot and therapeutic. I would use the empty group studios to lift light and spare my ego. I no longer needed the extension of machine options elsewhere -- just light weights and cardio equipment. But now I'm back physically (thanks to LT) and am able to compare both gyms again.\n\nThose Darn TVs: Le sigh. One place I like to escape it is at the gym, but LT has giant TVs plastered everywhere on the main gym floor. Given the current social and politial climate, it's distracting and disturbing. More mirrors. Fewer TVs, please. But to their credit, they changed the stations on request. I appreciate that.\n\nWater Fountain: It features distilled water for refilling your water bottle. High tech.\n\nCafe: An area that has remained great from opening day to the present is the cafe and lounge area. This has extended to outdoor seating. The way it's designed allows relative privacy almost anywhere you sit. There's also a really nice pool table and living room-like area overlooking the sky deck pool so that if you don't have a membership to that part, you can dream a little.\n\nSpecial Events: Some view this negatively. I view it as rather cool. It's NYC. Cool places make good spaces for photo shoots, movies and TV shows. There's always an email notification and the closings are infrequent and brief.\n\nClasses: I am physically better but not confident enough to do group classes post-injury (not related to the gym). However, I love that there are so many classes because I live next door. It would be great to come home from work and go right into a spin class. Who am I kidding? I come home and crash!\n\nConclusion:\nI like this gym. I am disappointed in a few minor things but overall, 4 of 5 stars isn't bad. And it's half the price of Equinox so that's a great deal.",

I was lied to, I was talked over, and I had my valid complaints completely looked over and dismissed by her instead of at least trying to make things right. I'm even more upset than I already was.\n\nAs my review on google explains, I walked into the 66 Boerum place location on a rainy 7/8/2022 and was informed by an employee after trying to check in using their broken scanning that they \"only allowed sneakers in the gym\" and that she previously saw me working out with my rainboots a few times before and wanted to let me know that they \"only allowed sneakers.\" I left upset because this is false (according to the FAQs on the website) and I didn't understand why she would watch me exercise (which is EXTREMELY creepy) wearing my boots instead of just simply approaching me to ask me to wear sneakers next time I come in.\n\nAfter repeated attempts to contact management over the weekend, I was called back today and after trying to express my concerns, the manager said that the employee \"was doing the right thing\" by telling me that they \"do not allow rainboots.\" I reiterated the PF FAQS, which said they don't allow anything \"offensive, rude, open toed, or hazardous.\" And I said that the employee explicitly said that they \"only allow sneakers\" (which is a lie), not that they \"don't allow rainboots.\"\n\nThe manager then CHANGED HER STORY and said that that \"that is true; we only allow sneakers.\" Then she said that the \"notice\" was located at the elevator.\n\nI asked her, \"Why would an important piece of information not be located at the door so that more people could see it??\" She openly acknowledged this.\n\nShe then CHANGED HER STORY AGAIN and said that this \"notice\" that I've never seen before was located at the front desk. I asked her why her employee would stare me down working out in my rainboots several times instead of telling me there was a possible problem. Manager had no answer for this. Instead, she constantly interrupted me and talked over me.\n\nI said that I would file a complaint to Planet Fitness and instead of trying to compensate or make things right for the major inconvenience, she simply kept saying \"ok, you can do that.

Fast forward, I move, try to transfer my base membership and I'm told I have to wait until my annual membership is up in order to do that. This was not what I was told when I purchased an annual membership. I was told that I could transfer at any time as I was planning to move being that I am sick and tired of dodging drug addicts, crazy people, and specifically right outside this gym, seeing people take dumps in broad daylight on the street corner.",

I hope that you'll give the workout another try as every single day is a completely different workout, focusing on variations of training from endurance, to strength, and to power. Additionally, you'll focus different muscle groups as well. If you like a challenge, you'd love our Signature Workouts and Benchmark Challenges that happen monthly. They provide the opportunity to achieve a distance or time goal against your own previous records, as well as your neighbors in class! We'll make sure to invite you to our next member mingle, as well, so you can meet the staff and fellow members.

It is more of a budget option (no towels, not even for showers) but again, would make it a good option for those breaking into fitness. I appreciate the screens; the weights portion has animations on a screen so that you can always look up for reference if needed. There were only two showers available (the third was broken) so you will have to rush to get one after class. You do have to buy a heart rate monitor as well.

            "UPDATE: elevators are out of order again and no email warning me about it.\nLast time I left a comment, Equinox left a comment below saying to reach out to them, guess what, I did and no response, what a joke. I guess 340 a month is not enough money to get the bare minimum respect.\n\nI am really sorry and upset to leave a bad review about this location. As a Destination Access member I pay over 300 dollars and expect to at least use the facility. I am really appalled by the fact that I've 3 out of the 5 times I've been to this location the elevators were not working. Thats pretty frightening because I am told they break all the time. And there is no other way to go to the 9th floor so if you book a class you might have to cancel it. Today I didn't wait for the technician to come like I waited yesterday and just left because who the hell has 45 minutes to waste",

            "From a fitness standpoint, this is a pretty solid gym. There's two floors with cardio equipment and lots of machines and weights. I personally like the bottom floor way more than the top cause it's super specious they have good number of benches, free weights and TRX cables.\n\nI'm really not a fan of the two floors being so far apart, the second floor of the gym is really the 9th floor and the elevator is INCREDIBLY slow. I genuinely don't think I've ever ridden on a slower elevator in my life. The locker rooms are also on the 9th floor so I often find myself wasting a lot of time going up and down between the main weight floor and the upper level.\n\nHowever the views especially from the yoga studio and rooftop patio are STUNNING. One of the best views of the city that I can recall. The rooftop pool itself doesn't have the best view and it's really small.\n\nIf they can figure out how to make the elevator more efficient, this gym has potential to be great.",

            "Every other day in the men's bathroom they run out of towels in the morning. I provide them this feedback and they simply ignore it. I am paying $360/month for Equinox to ignore me - someone please open up a high end gym in the area - I will send hundreds of people there.",

            "UPDATE: elevators are out of order again and no email warning me about it.\nLast time I left a comment, Equinox left a comment below saying to reach out to them, guess what, I did and no response, what a joke. I guess 340 a month is not enough money to get the bare minimum respect.\n\nI am really sorry and upset to leave a bad review about this location. As a Destination Access member I pay over 300 dollars and expect to at least use the facility. I am really appalled by the fact that I've 3 out of the 5 times I've been to this location the elevators were not working. Thats pretty frightening because I am told they break all the time. And there is no other way to go to the 9th floor so if you book a class you might have to cancel it. Today I didn't wait for the technician to come like I waited yesterday and just left because who the hell has 45 minutes to waste",

            "I have the all access membership so decided to pay Equinox Printing House a visit. I definitely had some mixed feelings about this location.\n\nFirst off, I have to say that I really enjoyed the downstairs area of the facility. It's open, airy, and feels relatively new. However, I was a bit thrown off by the fact that the upstairs is located on the 9th floor. It's a bit of a hassle to have to take an elevator all the way up there just to access the lockers. Also the upstairs area felt a little dated and in need of a renovation.\n\nOn a positive note, the views from the yoga studio and terrace added a nice touch to my workout and experience. I'm particularly excited about the pool area, which seems like the perfect place to relax on a hot summer afternoon. I can definitely see myself spending a lot of time there in the coming months.\n\nOverall, while there are some minor inconveniences to consider, my experience was positive, and I would recommend anyone in the area to check it out.",

            "Every other day in the men's bathroom they run out of towels in the morning. I provide them this feedback and they simply ignore it. I am paying $360/month for Equinox to ignore me - someone please open up a high end gym in the area - I will send hundreds of people there.",

            "Equinox Printing House is one of a kind. I cannot rave enough about the class instructors. They are Unlike any other club franchise-- a dedicated bunch! They ask about injuries before class and are accommodating. The front desk and shop staff are incredibly kind and welcoming. The cleaning staff are on it! The locker room is super clean and always stocked. The exercise areas are spotless and organized. only reason I dock a star is because the elevator is very slow so it takes a few minutes to get between floors.",
            "Guess what years later I finally received not one but three days of trial....and I had agreed to join after the first trial. See that's all you needed years ago... so weird. I was so easily convinced.\n\nTreadmills: they have the joint friendly ones, as well as the concave make your own speed one (forgive me I forget the names Woodley?) ... classes are like no other, filtered water, beautiful showers and I better buckle down on my diet so I can use the rooftop pool in style.\n\nMy only Peev is not enough mirror space for women's locker room at peak hour of 830am. Oh well ... it happens, elevator waiting sometimes is annoying but whatever. Beautiful well kept gym with top notch classes. I'll take it.\n\nBeautiful gym. Thanks.",
            "I have the all access membership so decided to pay Equinox Printing House a visit. I definitely had some mixed feelings about this location.\n\nFirst off, I have to say that I really enjoyed the downstairs area of the facility. It's open, airy, and feels relatively new. However, I was a bit thrown off by the fact that the upstairs is located on the 9th floor. It's a bit of a hassle to have to take an elevator all the way up there just to access the lockers. Also the upstairs area felt a little dated and in need of a renovation.\n\nOn a positive note, the views from the yoga studio and terrace added a nice touch to my workout and experience. I'm particularly excited about the pool area, which seems like the perfect place to relax on a hot summer afternoon. I can definitely see myself spending a lot of time there in the coming months.\n\nOverall, while there are some minor inconveniences to consider, my experience was positive, and I would recommend anyone in the area to check it out.",
            "IDK why the rating is low.\nEquinox is my fav gym. The classes are well selected, and instructors are energetic. And I love using their Apps to learn new trend about health stuff. Only one thing that I can think is the price. It indeed a expensive gym.... But still I prefer Equinox than other places. Less than $200 is totally worth it since I'm getting healthier. :)",
            "UPDATE: elevators are out of order again and no email warning me about it.\nLast time I left a comment, Equinox left a comment below saying to reach out to them, guess what, I did and no response, what a joke. I guess 340 a month is not enough money to get the bare minimum respect.\n\nI am really sorry and upset to leave a bad review about this location. As a Destination Access member I pay over 300 dollars and expect to at least use the facility. I am really appalled by the fact that I've 3 out of the 5 times I've been to this location the elevators were not working. Thats pretty frightening because I am told they break all the time.

            "Finally tried Barry's Bootcamp about 5 years after everyone else. To give context for comparison, I generally work out at SoulCycle and Rumble Boxing once or twice a week, and at Equinox. I was on a vacation (staycation) from work and saw a promotion (3 classes for $70 for first timer), so I figured why not.\n\nFirst time experience - the entire studio of Barry's Bootcamp Tribeca was incredibly welcoming for me as a first timer. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about. The front desk greeted me and explained where everything was. The shake bar filled up my reusable water bottle no problem, and asked me how my first time was after the class.\n\nInstructor - Kat was sooo awesome. I highly recommend her class. This was the only group fitness class that I've ever been to, where the instructor came over to me on my first time and explained how everything worked. She also gave personal attention and feedback on form during the work out, and asked how I felt after class.\n\nWork out - I went on Chest, Back and Abs day.. this workout was tough (in a good way)! It has been years since I've worked out my chest muscles to failure where I couldn't even do a push up, but by the end of the class I couldn't even do a push up. I felt good muscle soreness (the kind that leads to growth) for 3 days after the class.\n\nStudio - There are only 2 showers in the Men's locker room. There are 38 spots in the class. I live 3 subway stops away from this location. This is the main reason I probably won't become a regular at Barry's Bootcamp Tribeca. I sweated a ridiculous amount in this class, to the point where I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the building without a shower. I was able to get one, but I went on off hours (Wednesday 10:45am) because I was on vacation from work.\n\nOverall, I really liked my experience at Barry's Bootcamp. The number one reason I would be back would be to take more of Kat's classes, and the friendly staff. The smoothie after class was also very welcome and delicious (I got Chocolate Peanut Butter with egg white protein - no dairy). The only thing holding me back is the lack of showers. It's hard to choose to wait in line for shower, when other classes in the $36 per class price range have 4-6 showers with no wait. However, if you live within walking distance, it's a no brainer, this is a great studio.\n\nI will be back (definitely to use my remaining 2 classes), and maybe occasionally after that when I'm free on off peak hours.",
            "Workout - Grueling. I left limping and half dead (lower body focus day). It's mixture of running on the treadmill and free weights on the floor. If running isn't your thing, I recommend opting for \"double floor\" (FYI not an option on ClassPass).\n\nFacilities - One of the smaller studios in the city as it feels a bit cramped, everything from the studio to the lobby to the locker room. The men's locker room has two showers and two toilet stalls, but this isn't too much of an issue in the evening because I think this Barry's is more of a neighborhood gym as I saw people going home to shower. Based on the price point ($36/class), I expected higher quality products in locker room, at least that's the standard at other high-end fitness studios in the city. There is smoothie bar so you can per-order your post-workout smoothie, so that's a plus.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience and will be back.",
            "Probably one of my lesser favorite locations in the city. The layout is very cramped, no surprise as this is NYC, it it seemed excessively so. The red room itself was also by far the smallest studio I've experienced as well. Obviously, these things have no impact on the workout which is what matters!\n\nChecking in was easy enough and I found a panel of lockers on the lobby floor to put my stuff. We went in and our trainer proved to be dedicated, tough, and very clear about instructions and form.\n\nIt was definitely one of the tougher workouts, it was arms and abs day (smaller muscle groups = less calories burned) but I ended up burning more than I do in a total body workout.\n\nI took a quick shower afterwards, and while the locker room is absolutely tiny and the showers were dated, all the amenities were there as usual. Will probably continue to go to my regular locations, but I'm glad I've finally visited every Barry's in NYC!",
            "Tough and impressive workouts - I really like the concept of the even balance between cardio and weight training. Most classes circuit between treadmill and a station with mat for weight/body movements several times. The movement between stations is a bit hectic, so it can be a bit hard keeping up with the instructor or making sure you are on point with the exercises, especially when you are new.\n\nWorkouts are intense and exhausting with encouraging instructors. Despite their name, there's no drill sergeant vibe here - it's an enthusiastic and welcoming vibe. This location has a bar where you can pre-order a post-workout smoothie, which are expensive but quite good. The locker/showers are quite nice as well.\n\nThe cardio portion unfortunately is running on a treadmill in all Barry's classes. The equipment is incredibly modern and comfortable (tread/track style treadmill) but, Barry's protestations to the contrary, it is still running, and I do wish it were a different cardio component. So if running isn't your thing, I'd recommend it sporadically rather than as a regular class, which is how I approach it.",
            "Love the workouts here. The cardio can get pretty intense, especially the sprints when they ask you to run at a 9, 10 or 11 speed, but it always leaves you feeling exhausted (in a good way) at the end. The floor part will vary depending on the day of the week and on your instructor. Most of the instructors are great at demonstrating proper form for the moves and giving out cues along the way so it's easy to follow. The biggest downside is that the classes are quite expensive but I only come here on Classpass.",

            "Finally tried Barry's Bootcamp about 5 years after everyone else. To give context for comparison, I generally work out at SoulCycle and Rumble Boxing once or twice a week, and at Equinox. I was on a vacation (staycation) from work and saw a promotion (3 classes for $70 for first timer), so I figured why not.\n\nFirst time experience - the entire studio of Barry's Bootcamp Tribeca was incredibly welcoming for me as a first timer. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about. The front desk greeted me and explained where everything was. The shake bar filled up my reusable water bottle no problem, and asked me how my first time was after the class.\n\nInstructor - Kat was sooo awesome. I highly recommend her class. This was the only group fitness class that I've ever been to, where the instructor came over to me on my first time and explained how everything worked. She also gave personal attention and feedback on form during the work out, and asked how I felt after class.\n\nWork out - I went on Chest, Back and Abs day.. this workout was tough (in a good way)! It has been years since I've worked out my chest muscles to failure where I couldn't even do a push up, but by the end of the class I couldn't even do a push up. I felt good muscle soreness (the kind that leads to growth) for 3 days after the class.\n\nStudio - There are only 2 showers in the Men's locker room. There are 38 spots in the class. I live 3 subway stops away from this location. This is the main reason I probably won't become a regular at Barry's Bootcamp Tribeca. I sweated a ridiculous amount in this class, to the point where I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the building without a shower. I was able to get one, but I went on off hours (Wednesday 10:45am) because I was on vacation from work.\n\nOverall, I really liked my experience at Barry's Bootcamp. The number one reason I would be back would be to take more of Kat's classes, and the friendly staff. The smoothie after class was also very welcome and delicious (I got Chocolate Peanut Butter with egg white protein - no dairy). The only thing holding me back is the lack of showers. It's hard to choose to wait in line for shower, when other classes in the $36 per class price range have 4-6 showers with no wait. However, if you live within walking distance, it's a no brainer, this is a great studio.\n\nI will be back (definitely to use my remaining 2 classes), and maybe occasionally after that when I'm free on off peak hours.",

Free for kids and teenagers and even cheaper for senior citizens and former military.\n\nSIDE NOTE: All NYC rec centers with indoor pools are more expensive than those without.\n\n-Lots of classes of all kinds. Art, senior movement, fitness, pool tables, ping pong, the list goes on.\n\n-A decent pool and good sized gym with lots of equipment. A nice studio/multi-purpose room.\n\n-Good group of people\n\n-As far as gym goes for a rec center, this place is one of the best spots I've lifted in. There's tons of dumbbells, machines, two top-of-the-line squats racks, lots of benches, apparatuses for machines, etc. For the money you pay, you can get some serious work in. I can get as much as a workout here as I can at any fancy, schmancy gym.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-From my experience the staff can be hit or miss. Not particularly friendly but not outright assholes either. Then you have those who are very friendly and cordial. Not particular a bad thing but if I had to put a bad thing down.\n\n-A lot of the gym equipment can sometimes be outdated or not in use. GRANTED, they have recently made some nice updates, so there's even more room and more, up-to-date equipment in the gym.\n\n-The scheduling can be a little annoying sometimes. Again, not a bad thing but annoying. For instance, there's times I want to use the multi-studio room but there's days when I go when its listed as there being no classes in the room, there ends up being a class. Stupid things like that.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n-This place is not the prettiest place, aesthetically. It's definitely not the ugliest place I've ever been too and personally, I don't give a damn. I give a damn about getting my workout in and that's all. However, if aesthetics are a big deal for you, then this is not going to cut it. Yes, there's other rec centers that are brighter, prettier, more colorful than this rather darker, danker place but again, you come here to work out. If you need pretty, its definitely not pretty but its \"Aight\".\n\nEnd Game: You CANNOT go wrong with this place, truthfully. For the amount of money you pay, you really can't go wrong. \"It pays for itself\". No losing with this place.",
            "This review is solely for the weight room of Asser Levy, because I have never used the pool!\n\nIf you're looking for a fancy gym with bright lights, pumping music and top-of-the-line machines, you will not like Asser Levy. However, it really does have everything you need - Tons of cardio machines considering the size, dumbbells (although mostly unlabeled and some are missing), barbells, squat rack, leg press, smith machine, a couple cable machines, lat pulldowns, leg extension, leg curl, abductor/adductor machine, incline decline and flat bench, and a few other machines. There is a stretching sections and they also have foam rollers and some other fitness equipment (mats, steps).\n\nUmmm, considering the price of this place, that is an amazing variety of equipment, and if you can't get a good workout from that, stop being a diva!\n\nLike most gyms, Asser Levy has it's \"rush hour\"s (I would say about 5-6pm on weekdays) where you may have to wait to use the machine you want or hunt for a good spot to set up. Aim to get to the gym in the early mornings if you can!\n\nNot only does Asser Levy have all the equipment you need, but it also has an amazing community. I like to say people here have \"no filter\" - they will come up to you and say whatever they feel like saying, and for the most part, everybody is very supportive and friendly. This gym is full of really strong and impressive lifters, but none of them are stuck up jerks. There is no better motivation to go to the gym than to be surrounded by people who are always happy and helpful.\n\nYou may not be impressed by the aesthetics of Asser Levy when you first come here, but it will grow on you and you will start to have fun meeting some very interesting/quirky people!",
            "Update!!\n\nAsset Levy no longer has gender discriminating ladies night or men's night. I recieved confirmation from the manager of Asser Levy, who advised that this policy is no longer in place. Feel free to arrive at all posted fitness room hours.\n------\n\nOriginal Review: 2 stars\n\nDid you know that Asser Levy Rec Center has gender discrimination practices? On Tuesdays, it has women's fitness night from 8 to 9:30PM and on Thursdays it has men's' fitness only nights from 8 to 9:30PM. The rules are not listed on Rec Center schedule, so women and men who go on these nights are harassed and kicked out! Appalling!",
            "Too packed. People jumping everywhere. If you want to swim, not the place to be. Plus not enough benches or seats.",
            "I would've lowered the rating to a 1, but since it is a free rec center for people aged under 18, i cut the place some slack. The place inside is very dirty, my friend had brought me there so we could go lift some weights, and to hit the gym. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a strong scent of chlorine. Although, this is common, if you do not like this particular scent, you might not want to go.\n\nThe Caucasian lady working in the front desk (works on fridays 3 PM?) who provided me my ID card was very nice. Her service was splendid, and she showed no sign of anger. She helped me through the process and was overall a helpful person.\n\nWhen I went into the weight room, I was greeted by weary weights, dirty floors, and the scent of body odor. The body odor is common, but c'mon, atleast get a damn glade or something in there. During our workout there was a woman talking to herself, and talking to other people (including me) randomly. I was told that she always talked to herself, and she was kind of cuckoo for a lack of a better term. After our workout, while we stretched a saw a centipede crawl around, and immediately I left. If the place would've been cleaner, it would be fine. However, it is a free rec center for people younger than 18.",
            "Wonderful place with full facilities, nice people and best price! Help me a lot in finding back my confidence and health!\n\nVery grateful, enjoyable and unforgettable!\n\nBest,\nWilla",
            "DISGUSTING.\n\nRoaches in lockers, broken exercise machines, some members smell so badly it could singe your nose hairs, men hog the machines--lots of phone use instead of leaving the machine, they act as if it's their personal office.\n\nThe piece du resistance? Caught a few of the older men checking out my crotch!",

There is a stretching sections and they also have foam rollers and some other fitness equipment (mats, steps).\n\nUmmm, considering the price of this place, that is an amazing variety of equipment, and if you can't get a good workout from that, stop being a diva!\n\nLike most gyms, Asser Levy has it's \"rush hour\"s (I would say about 5-6pm on weekdays) where you may have to wait to use the machine you want or hunt for a good spot to set up. Aim to get to the gym in the early mornings if you can!\n\nNot only does Asser Levy have all the equipment you need, but it also has an amazing community. I like to say people here have \"no filter\" - they will come up to you and say whatever they feel like saying, and for the most part, everybody is very supportive and friendly. This gym is full of really strong and impressive lifters, but none of them are stuck up jerks. There is no better motivation to go to the gym than to be surrounded by people who are always happy and helpful.\n\nYou may not be impressed by the aesthetics of Asser Levy when you first come here, but it will grow on you and you will start to have fun meeting some very interesting/quirky people!",

The body odor is common, but c'mon, atleast get a damn glade or something in there. During our workout there was a woman talking to herself, and talking to other people (including me) randomly. I was told that she always talked to herself, and she was kind of cuckoo for a lack of a better term. After our workout, while we stretched a saw a centipede crawl around, and immediately I left.

A nice studio/multi-purpose room.\n\n-Good group of people\n\n-As far as gym goes for a rec center, this place is one of the best spots I've lifted in. There's tons of dumbbells, machines, two top-of-the-line squats racks, lots of benches, apparatuses for machines, etc. For the money you pay, you can get some serious work in.

The best part for me is the community who continually push you to do better - and it's honestly a pleasure to wake up in the morning and go work out with my new friends!",
            "Have been training at this gym since it opened. Can't imagine working out and getting ready for summer anywhere else. The coaches are awesome, the members are fun, and the music is HOPPING. You can create your own playlist on Spotify and play it during class. You may have to fight a B for playing rights, but hey, sometimes you gotta lift to Cardi B otherwise you won't PR.\n\nAlso, this gym is very LGBTQ and STRAIGHT friendly. They don't care how short my shorts are, cuz lifting at this gym will give you legs for days....",

Bagel before working out? Nope. It'll wind up in the trash can anyway.\n\nSeriously this gym is for a drill, not a workout. In \"drill\" i think military and it's really close to that. Excellent mix of people to boot, and it makes for a great experience overall.",
            "Overall a solid box: attentive coaches, well maintained facilities, and it's got tons of conveniently scheduled classes.\n\nOne gripe. Unlike most CrossFit classes in NYC, the programming at Oculus is very repetitive and powerlifting focused--many classes I walk out feeling like I haven't worked out. There are long breaks in between sets and only 3-5 minutes allotted to conditioning. My advice to management would be to mix up the workouts with more conditioning or A/B sets: many of us work in office jobs and need to move more!",
            "COVID UPDATE: I LOVE this gym. Prior to covid this gym was fantastic, amazing coaches, great programming, clean facility, members who are kind and encouraging. Now Oculus has maintained its excellent qualities and is 100% following all safety measures. All members in masks, temp checks, cleaning equipment, HVACs, more than 6 ft distanced. I never am nervous coming to workout with my Oculus family. The programming is killer, and comes with modifications for all levels so beginners or pros will all feel challenged, happy and safe. I can't say enough kind things about this place, it's more than a gym, it's a family and home. If you are even considering finding a new gym please stop in and talk to Benson, you won't regret it!",

            "There is something about this pool that attracts men filled with rage. Several different times I've been more or less assaulted by guys who decide they must circle swim (instead of just waiting- the turnover is fast). I've been clocked on the head, left bleeding on my right hand and guys I don't know scream at me. I sometimes go to Columbus Circle which is larger and more relaxed but it's inconvenient from where I live and work. I'm almost 60 years old and I feel anxious every time I go.

            "AVOID. I was an Equinox member since 1998 when I joined the club on broadway in Flatiron. I am a former professional athlete so I know my way around a gym, appropriate gym etiquette and behavior.\n\nI have always had an all access membership and used a bunch of clubs when proximate to either work or home (85th St, Rock Center, 63rd St, or in LA or Chi when traveling). For the past 5 years, I predominately used the 63rd St and Rock Center locations and I am friendly with the staff and trainers (with whom I worked regularly).\n\nSadly, there have been a number of management changes at the 63rd St location from people I had known as friends for years, to the current manager who's most recent experience was as a floor manager for Ralph Lauren clothing store (no point using his name).\n\nWhen dealing with a customer service issue, the manager told me that \"we don't need your business... we are turning away members....\". He was hysterically dictatorial in our discussion - making threats and ultimatums with this progressing to the point where I was laughing out loud at some of his statements.\n\nInitially, I thought his approach must be the result of a bad day, but since that interaction, I have heard similar stories about this individual from neighbors (two families on my block!) other members and former members and staff. He has quite a following in the neighborhood surrounding the 62nd St club of disaffected folks...\n\nNow I train at Crunch on Lex which is a more than adequate facility with several other locations around the city available for use as well. Another plus at Crunch is friendly management team with little danger of running into a clown-show dictator! ;-)\n\nA bunch of former members (10-15) are also members at Crunch on 3rd btwn 66-67 as a result with their interactions at the club and with this person. Lots of people are talking about this so I'm certain there are many others out there - if you have had a similar experience, please share...\n\nAnyone reading this will be astonished to learn that the fitness club industry, which is a state of significant repose, would actually drive away members. This is especially true for Equinox which is teetering on the verge of insolvency and reorganization and can't afford to lose a single member.\n\nAvoid this chain and particularly this location, unless you are looking for a good laugh.",

            "Clean, always available machines. The front desk always smiling and welcoming. The staff are just super helpful. There is always someone available to answer questions at any given moment. That's the customer service you cannot buy! I Let's talk about the amenities, spa, steam room, I love it here!",
            "Breakdown of the pool from a collegiate swimmer:\n\nMainly signed up for daily use of the pool. Wonderful gym all around with a great pool - little longer wait for the pool in certain hours or on weekends and a little on the smaller end but worth it in my opinion if you are able to sign up.\n\nSome tips for new members for the pool:\n\nSwim times are 30min max (if no one is there then you may swim as long as you want).\n\nA lane is secured not by reservation, but by first-come, first-serve and you must be present by the pool ready to swim while waiting for a lane, you cannot leave to go do something while waiting. Busiest times are early morning (0600-0900) and late evening (7pm-9pm) where the wait is about an hour minimum, but during the middle of the day it's fairly slow actually and wait times for a lane are only about 10-30min. Try to swim in the middle of the day, not at night.\n\nSwim cap must be worn at all times while in the water, no matter the stroke or exercise.\n\nWater is great temp and very clean.\n\nTowels available in locker room for use.\n\nOverall, really a great gym. I'd say if you're signing up in order to use the pool before the city opens again and you do not mind the shorter swim times and a little bit of a wait, just don't swim at night or early morning. Try to swim in the early/mid afternoon and you'll be good to go!\n\nRest of the gym is great as well and I'm actually surprised with the equipment - they have most functional equipment needed for solid weight training. This can become a busy gym, but it's very clean and they respect the freedoms of members vaccinated to be massless which is really cool.\n\nHuge thanks to Rachel for helping me out with everything! Definitely try to sign up with her if you can, she's solid and will work with you.",
            "Hi Peter, thank you for taking the time out to leave us your review! We appreciate your feedback, especially as a collegiate swimmer. Rest assured, we will escalate your insight to our management team. While waiting for the pool, feel free to take a moment and use the Cold Plunge.",
            "I have been so beyond ready to come back to the gym and was excited to see that equinox was open and ready for business.\nYou must schedule an appointment via the app. You are allowed in 30 min prior to scheduled appointment and 90 from appointment time. Lots of time to get workouts in!\nThey provide towels both large and small at the desk. You must scan your temperature at the touch less checker, and then check in from the app.\nThe locker rooms are one level down. Nice and clean, as always. Lockers are limited to enforce social distancing. They are marked with a sticker. Showers are open and also limited due to social distancing. They don't have any of the amenities yet (besides lotion).\nThey limit the amount of people in the gym so everyone is pretty spread out. Wipe down the equipment before and after as usual. The pool is open and you have to let them know if you will be using the pool so they can also enforce social distancing there.\nYou will see the staff constantly cleaning and I've seen them walk around with the sanitizer spraying down the equipment as well.\nYou must wear your mask even when exercising except when taking a drink of water.\nSo glad the gym is open again!!",

            "I took a tour of this gym with Chris and it was very impressive. If you are looking to join, Chris is the guy to speak to! He is nice and friendly, like your new best friend. I had the opportunity to take the Zumba and vinyasa yoga classes here. The main studio is large and comfortable, can accommodate the 20+ people taking the energetic Zumba class. Then, I relaxed with a yoga class in another studio, where they also have the barre and Pilates classes. Best stretch of my life and I have paid to get stretched several times. The eucalyptus steam room is great for relaxing especially now that the weather is getting cooler. The women's locker room has everything you need to get ready: shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, lotion, deodorant. The only thing is the hairdryer is not that strong: or maybe I just don't have the patience to dry my hair.\n\nIf you are looking to join, ask for Chris T! He even told me about a special event where they were giving out equinox bags and healthy snacks. I really enjoyed the Hippeas organic chickpea puffs, which are healthy cheese puffs that taste better than the unhealthy stuff!",

            "I have been so beyond ready to come back to the gym and was excited to see that equinox was open and ready for business.\nYou must schedule an appointment via the app. You are allowed in 30 min prior to scheduled appointment and 90 from appointment time. Lots of time to get workouts in!\nThey provide towels both large and small at the desk. You must scan your temperature at the touch less checker, and then check in from the app.\nThe locker rooms are one level down. Nice and clean, as always. Lockers are limited to enforce social distancing. They are marked with a sticker. Showers are open and also limited due to social distancing. They don't have any of the amenities yet (besides lotion).\nThey limit the amount of people in the gym so everyone is pretty spread out. Wipe down the equipment before and after as usual. The pool is open and you have to let them know if you will be using the pool so they can also enforce social distancing there.\nYou will see the staff constantly cleaning and I've seen them walk around with the sanitizer spraying down the equipment as well.\nYou must wear your mask even when exercising except when taking a drink of water.\nSo glad the gym is open again!!",

Then, I relaxed with a yoga class in another studio, where they also have the barre and Pilates classes. Best stretch of my life and I have paid to get stretched several times. The eucalyptus steam room is great for relaxing especially now that the weather is getting cooler.

            "I took a tour of this gym with Chris and it was very impressive. If you are looking to join, Chris is the guy to speak to! He is nice and friendly, like your new best friend. I had the opportunity to take the Zumba and vinyasa yoga classes here. The main studio is large and comfortable, can accommodate the 20+ people taking the energetic Zumba class. Then, I relaxed with a yoga class in another studio, where they also have the barre and Pilates classes. Best stretch of my life and I have paid to get stretched several times. The eucalyptus steam room is great for relaxing especially now that the weather is getting cooler. The women's locker room has everything you need to get ready: shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, lotion, deodorant. The only thing is the hairdryer is not that strong: or maybe I just don't have the patience to dry my hair.\n\nIf you are looking to join, ask for Chris T! He even told me about a special event where they were giving out equinox bags and healthy snacks. I really enjoyed the Hippeas organic chickpea puffs, which are healthy cheese puffs that taste better than the unhealthy stuff!",

            "Amazing self service ping pong place! It was very cool and required no human interaction.\nIt was very spacious and my friends and I really enjoyed playing here.\n\nSome things I do have to say is that the blinds suddenly went up as we were playing and I had to search the entire room to find out how to bring it back down.\n\nAlso, the website for Pingpod was a bit misleading and I ended up getting charged for drinks twice. It light up green for a few seconds to indicate success and then disappeared. There was no option to cancel so it was very easy to charge on the website but not quite to get a refund. Ended calling and got back in credits because they said they couldn't cancel the charge (disappointing)\n\nOverall though, great place and special shoutout to the slack community that appears to be very active.",
            "One of the nicer pingpod joints I have visited in the NYC area , this location on the lower east side is spacious , tables are spread out , plenty of sunlight enters and it's clean . Simple concept is you open a free account, add your credit card to rent table time , pick the date and time and the access code lets you enter about a half hour before your play time starts. Your name is shown on the screen and what table is yours for the next hour hour, one hour or longer. I usually don't hang around this part of town but I am here today and the place is perfectly set up for some good ping pong action. Not crowded at all as it's early in the afternoon so I can yell and insult my cuz while I slam a killer shot pass his outstretched paddle. Ping pod on the lower east side gets 4.5 stars on my yelp meter .",
            "Came for an hour session Saturday night with a friend. Super easy to unlock the door - just don't forget your log in or actually download the app.\n\nMy name was on the iPad next to one of the tables and I was able to add my friend's name who I was playing with. It shows the score and you can edit the length of the game you want to play. There were paddles and a basket of balls for our table. If you get a point, you can press the button under the table and the iPad reflects it!! So easy and cool.\n\nThere's also lockers, merch for sale and drinks/snacks in case you come in from work and need an energy boost.\n\nWe played for an hour! Didn't notice how time flew by.

On the second table, there were two scoring buttons, but one of the scoring buttons you had to press many times for scoring to even register, and when it did, it would sometimes remove points!

            "One of the nicer pingpod joints I have visited in the NYC area , this location on the lower east side is spacious , tables are spread out , plenty of sunlight enters and it's clean . Simple concept is you open a free account, add your credit card to rent table time , pick the date and time and the access code lets you enter about a half hour before your play time starts. Your name is shown on the screen and what table is yours for the next hour hour, one hour or longer. I usually don't hang around this part of town but I am here today and the place is perfectly set up for some good ping pong action. Not crowded at all as it's early in the afternoon so I can yell and insult my cuz while I slam a killer shot pass his outstretched paddle. Ping pod on the lower east side gets 4.5 stars on my yelp meter .",
            "Came for an hour session Saturday night with a friend. Super easy to unlock the door - just don't forget your log in or actually download the app.\n\nMy name was on the iPad next to one of the tables and I was able to add my friend's name who I was playing with. It shows the score and you can edit the length of the game you want to play. There were paddles and a basket of balls for our table. If you get a point, you can press the button under the table and the iPad reflects it!! So easy and cool.\n\nThere's also lockers, merch for sale and drinks/snacks in case you come in from work and need an energy boost.\n\nWe played for an hour! Didn't notice how time flew by.

            "Hello and welcome to my weird world of gym shower reviews. I'm on a roll now and I've visited so many Equinox locations at this point I feel like I have to discuss the differences somewhere. My friends won't listen to me anymore and my coworkers politely change the subject when I want to talk about really amazing showers.\n\nI'm gonna give Tribeca the benefit of a reasonable assumption that because I visited at a peak before-work hour, they couldn't keep up with cleaning during the shower traffic influx. The shower itself was good and big, but I was distracted because it was a little dirty with hair in the drain. Overall, it was still cleaner than other competitor gyms like *shudders* 24 Hour Fitness.\n\nThe definitive Equinox shower power ranking (so far):\n1. Williamsburg\n2. East 92nd\n3. SoHo\n4. Tribeca\n5. West 92nd\n6. Greenwich Ave",
            "They keep raising the prices, well over $15 this year and this place keeps getting more worn out. The showers are falling apart and the sinks have no aerators so they just spit out water. Some of the shower heads are broken or have a small stream. On the floor - you can see old ac and heating units in need of repair. Place is cramped during busy times and machines are as good as crunch. Not worth $300+ a month - more like a Nysc vibe\n\nCompare this to any equinox, this is really one of the worst",
            "We appreciate your honest feedback, BC!",
            "Everyone here is super nice and the equipment is good. On high traffic times you will have to wait awhile to use what you want to use but that's somewhat usual. Out of all the equinoxes I go to, this is the most unspectacular and run down in terms of appearance.",
            "This place gets the job done but in serious need of an update/facelift. I would say that's ok but if you're paying $250+ for a membership, you don't want to go to one that looks like NYSC\n\nPeople here are super nice tho and service is good",
            "This is for my encounter with the bathroom attendant, who told me I'm only allowed to get one razor. I like a different razor for my legs and another for my armpits. For my $325+ a month, for which I don't even attend the gym that' much due to work from home, Equinox should not have someone obnoxious in the ladies locker room to limit amenities. I should be able to use as many razors as I want! Please stop this nonsense in the most expensive neighborhood in NY: Tribeca!\n\nIt should also be noted that the shower water was ice cold for 4 minutes, so they should check on that, Also, I noticed an unusual amount of fallen hair in the shower. I was afraid to even step in the shower there was so much hair. Please clean the showers!",

            "I took two classes here. Best Butt Ever and Barre. The Best Butt Ever claim I would have to dispute, but it was a convenient half hour during lunchtime and it is great for taking a break. I would recommend Equinox to take a look at the Brazil Butt Lift workout by Leandro Carvalho and Beachbody and target the three butt muscles instead of the million squats we had to do. In fact, why not hire Leandro Carvalho to teach the class? Leandro really does know how to get you the best butt ever.\n\nAs for the Barre class at 5:30 pm, it was one of the best barre classes I've taken. Much better than Pure Barre in Tribeca, much more luxurious facilities.",
            "The worst equinox facility in the city.\nIt's Small, Old machines, dirty and it has the least amount of amenities when compared to Soho or Brookfield.

It's very clean and spacious and maybe the bad experiences are of when it's very busy or some other reason. It has plenty of equipment and the staff I find to be helpful if you need anything or have a concern. I try to visit this location when I can since the location is close to the train and other areas of interest such as coffee and meals afterwards if you want. Try to be careful with the usual busy times but aside from that it's a nice place to workout and shower, clean up afterwards.",

I was told that the cycling studio would be open for anyone to use as long as there wasn't a class, but it was locked when I tried to go in, even though there was nobody inside.

            "I just took a weight lifting class called Stronger with Lauren and it was fantastic! My doctor said I need to lift weights to lower the A1C blood sugar to get healthier. Of course I would also like to look better but health is my main focus now. Lauren played very motivating music and the class was high energy! At one point my heart rate went up to 146, which never happens when I'm on the treadmill. I'm so glad I took Stronger!\n\nIn my opinion, Equinox Wall Street is one of the coolest clubs I've visited so far. Very large locker room! Luxurious and roomy!",

We told them we wanted to cancel at the beginning of the year, and they said no way, we have to wait 6 mo. The hours are terrible on the weekend. We paid the steep monthly price so we could be in walking distance, not to get on the train and go to Brooklyn.",

            "I really enjoyed my time as a member of Equinox Wall Street. The facilities were always clean and the classes were great!\n\nThe only reason I did not give it five stars is because the water was consistently being shut off during my short time as a member. This could have been due to construction happening outside the building, but for those that use the gym for the shower and/or sauna this could be a real pain.",
            "Disclaimer: this is a bit of a rant. Every sunday I go here to take my yoga class taught by my one and only yoga instructor. I personally will not take it with anyone else. She kicks my butt and I always feel inferior, but she always says that we do not work in the circus, do your best, and all that matters is that you made it.\n\nThis location used to be one of my favorite spots due to how nice it is and because it is one of few locations that has a flat iron. The flat iron can we a better one, but I will take it. However, the past few months, the yoga studio has been icy cold. Members have complained, including myself and nothing has been done. I hope that this review will get their attention and we will finally have an appropriately heated studio. Especially during these 19 degrees times, borderline should be illegal.

Good equipment and generally not too long of a wait. Fair price for what you pay, plus with rewards points if you go enough as I do, you can shave off about 2 months yearly...so, makes it well worth it.\n\nCons: A bit on the smaller side, but manage to get my workout done with little to no wait during the majority of my workout. The free weights has these little spikes in the middle where you put your hands and I need to wear gloves...I hope it gets worn down or they get a smooth surfaced hand grip at some point. Also, the short haired woman that minds the front on the weekends is very indifferent..I'm not saying mean, but if someone says hi to you, you should look up from what ur doing and have friendly hi back, not too much to ask for, right? So, now I just grab my towel and ignore her as well.\n\nGood gym and overall satisfied!",
            "The gym works great for me. I have a daytime only membership, which I find to be reasonably priced. The equipment works well and is kept clean (by patrons and staff). They have a good variety of equipment, and I can pretty much always use the equipment that I want without a wait. Staff is friendly and helpful.",

            "General manager Joe Blomfield is incredibly nasty. He will prefer to lie in order to make his actions acceptable rather than just apologize for his rudeness. Shows absolutely no understanding of common decency for paying gym members. Due to his inability to be respectful I had to cancel my membership and will never set foot inside that location, even though I am a current Stuytown resident. In addition, place is overpriced for what it offers. There are better alternatives than this gym, believe me.\n\nUpdate: I absolutely have no problem on following guidelines to protect everyone (that's why I decided to go by myself, to a separate room, surrounded by glass to do a workout). I just can deal with rude and nasty, people, who are unable to apologize and most definitely a General Manager who showed that day he is incapable of doing his job. Crazy enough Joe's boss agrees with me.",

Masks are to be worn for the protection of your neighbors, the team, and the community.

Beware as the temperature there last week was stifling (71 degrees - I took a picture).

            "Having visited several Blinks (NoHo, 125th, Astoria), this one is surprisingly less crowded, especially around 5 PM. Like all Blinks, the real attraction in NYC is the affordable price, but being under Equinox ownership ensures a certain level of quality. Blinks are generally well-maintained, clean, and equipped with decent locker rooms. While more space and additional free weights and benches would be appreciated, considering the price, it's still impressive.\nThe Chelsea location, being underground, tends to get quite warm, but its central location in Manhattan is a plus. Enhancing the air conditioning would make the experience even more enjoyable.",
            "Tried to cancel my personal training membership and was told to come in person so I did . I interacted with the Chelsea manager who said the kiosk that is uses to cancel the PT session not working and said you are all set . When I told manager that I had to sign a document , he started to shout at me saying I'm the manager and you don't need to sign any document since you're all set . I stood my ground and insisted that I signed a document and instead of being professional , respectful and helpful ; shoved me off to the other stuff to deal with me . Wow , not sure if this is type if behavior and treatment blink allows their staff be at manager to treat one of their long time customer",
            "Customer service is in fact not very helpful when it comes to accommodating customer grievances. I tried to cancel my membership because I moved out of state but was continuously charged even after requesting that I cancel my membership. The blink app does not allow easy cancellation and their 12 month policy actually acts as more of a determent to joining. Definitely needs an upgrade to worry regards to how they help their customers.",
            "This gym located in a basement features a vast variety of machines, free weights, four squat racks, only one bench press rack, and one incline bench rack. There's also a section for yoga and stretching. Unfortunately the gym will get pretty packed so the racks are often taken. Otherwise, the staff and friendly and the membership is a lot cheaper than its competitors'.",

            "I went today to use my first and only guest pass purchased via my own email address. they wouldn't let me in no matter what reasoning I gave them. They clearly are lying to my face. They said that because I had visited other locations in the past through ClassPass that I wasn't new to crunch. I was definitely new to this location. I would never get a gym membership without trying out the facilities. They wanted to charge me $35 for 30 minutes of basic exercise. my friend was inside waiting for me. She had a free guest pass and came down so I could use hers since they were giving me so much trouble. They would not let her use her pass on me either. I've tried to call HQ and their number is disabled. It's clear that crunch doesn't have any upper management and the facilities do whatever they feel. I'm hoping this problem can be escalated. They also refused to call upper management for me. The gym is small and facilities are a little bit dirty. The \"tour\" I was taken on took two minutes and didn't actually show me anything.\n\nEdit: through the grapevine I heard that the GM said he would have let me work out if I was nicer to him. Guess what. I was very nice in the beginning. Just more proof they discriminate and make their own rules.",

            "It is interesting how each Crunch location is extremely different from one another. Stopped by this location for convenience and that there was a spin class open at the time. The location is in the heart of midtown close to Herald Square and not too far from Times Square. The inside is brightly colored with neon colors. Head up to the second floor for the spin studio. I didn't realize the 'live swerve' classes meant you are watching an instructor virtually teaching the class \"live.\" There were barely 3 people taking the class and now I see why. The video screen would freeze up, sometimes no sound, and it took some time for an employee to check on this. The sad part is for any class you sign up for if you don't cancel 2 hours in advance there is a charge. However, its frustrating taking a class and then having technical difficulties. I'd probably avoid this kind of class again and stick to an instructor in person. They don't offer as much variety in classes at this location. This is more of a place to use the machines.\n\nHead up one more level to where all the main gym space is. There is another studio there which hosts classes. The remaining space includes all the machines, weights, punching bags, etc. The overall space and machines were decent and towels/wipes were consistently being picked up. In the evenings, the machines and weight areas can fill up quite a bit. Go mid-day on a weekday and you'll have a lot more space to workout. What's nice is there is a little lounge area outside the locker rooms where you can relax, charge your phone (bring your own cord), and perhaps have a snack. I sat here after my class to relax, but was interrupted by an employee hopping over to the seat next to be to flirt. Smh.\n\nThe women's locker room has a dry sauna, but no steam room. You must bring your own lock for the lockers. For some reason there were a lot of locks that had signs on them stating they would be cut off. They have showers with Rituals shower gel/shampoo/conditioner. They also have Rituals hand soap and mouthwash by the sinks. Hand held hair dryers also available and plenty of towels when you walk in.\n\nOverall, an okay space to workout. It gets very crowded on weeknights, the class options are limited (or fill up fast), and no steam room. Electronics for spin classes need more attention. Didn't see an elevator. So expect to climb three levels of stairs to reach the top. They sell drinks and merch on the main level and sales team is right there to sell their plan to you.",

            "First time at Crunch with a day pass. I understand that it's in the gyms best interest to convert days passes to memberships, however I also don't like to be pressured into anything that I don't feel comfortable with. Any info about myself that I provided to the guy that was supposed to show me around felt like it wasn't good enough. Eventually he didn't show me around, maybe cos he sensed doubt in me converting.\n\nMy encounter at the lobby with the guy made me feel so uncomfortable that it affected me during my workout too. Honestly, I left the gym feeling pretty negative about Crunch. I usually feel empowered after a gym session, not after a mood ruining encounter. (I used to be a blink member but it got too crowded). Will be checking out nysc instead.\n\nI'm sure the guy didn't mean to make me feel uncomfortable since it's his job to understand why I'm here at crunch, however I'd suggest he watch the tone he uses, and the choice of words when responding, esp to answers that might not be what he's expecting. He comes off passive aggressive/ gaslighting\n\nSaid things like \"Are you trying to say you're better than me? Cos that's what it sounds like.\" And \"do you work for the CIA or something?\" I was so put off by a lot of things he was saying and felt like that's not the way I'd like to be spoken to as a potential client.\n\nAs someone who has worked in the retail and customer service industry for many years, I know how people can get-- I can assure you I am not one of those people. I'm patient and try to be as easy as possible since I know what it's like. With that being said, there are ways to circle back to a question if a customer is not answering it to your liking. Maybe his tactics works in car dealership sales where he can be harsh to get what's needed, but in gym sales where you are interacting with customers, and a customer who needs to feel comfortable at a gym-- his tactics doesn't work.\n\nPros:\n- Bathrooms are nice & spacious.\n-The classes looked cool, idk what it was tho but there were a lot of ppl with headphones\n\nCons:\n-Dumbbells only go up to 65.\n-Bench press area crowded + nearby weight barbell rack makes it hard to walk around there",

            "For the third time in a few months, had an issue with a trainer feeling like they own the space.\nToday a trainer asked if his client could work in. There is no rule about this and I never signed saying I agreed to this. I declined politely and the trainer tried to explain the circuit his client was doing, further wasting more time when he could have moved on. I then noticed he and his client were monopolizing 8 pieces of equipment.\nGranted the gym was not busy, but his act of placing towels on all the machines he wanted felt agressive.\n\nLook, I get training clients as I spent a decade as a private training for a private training gym. However, he asked politely to work in, I declined, that should have been the end. But the comments made to his client within ear shot of me were simply unprofessional and unnecessary. If crunch would like the policy to be mandatory to allow someone to work in, then give out new contracts stating as much and I will take my business elsewhere. Not that it matters to crunch to lose one member or not. But reign in your trainers. They aren't the gods they think they are. And while you're at it, have them check out the form they instruct clients on. I routinely see them instructing clients in ways that will absolutely cause injury.",

            "It is interesting how each Crunch location is extremely different from one another. Stopped by this location for convenience and that there was a spin class open at the time. The location is in the heart of midtown close to Herald Square and not too far from Times Square. The inside is brightly colored with neon colors. Head up to the second floor for the spin studio. I didn't realize the 'live swerve' classes meant you are watching an instructor virtually teaching the class \"live.\" There were barely 3 people taking the class and now I see why. The video screen would freeze up, sometimes no sound, and it took some time for an employee to check on this. The sad part is for any class you sign up for if you don't cancel 2 hours in advance there is a charge. However, its frustrating taking a class and then having technical difficulties. I'd probably avoid this kind of class again and stick to an instructor in person. They don't offer as much variety in classes at this location. This is more of a place to use the machines.\n\nHead up one more level to where all the main gym space is. There is another studio there which hosts classes. The remaining space includes all the machines, weights, punching bags, etc. The overall space and machines were decent and towels/wipes were consistently being picked up. In the evenings, the machines and weight areas can fill up quite a bit. Go mid-day on a weekday and you'll have a lot more space to workout. What's nice is there is a little lounge area outside the locker rooms where you can relax, charge your phone (bring your own cord), and perhaps have a snack. I sat here after my class to relax, but was interrupted by an employee hopping over to the seat next to be to flirt. Smh.\n\nThe women's locker room has a dry sauna, but no steam room. You must bring your own lock for the lockers. For some reason there were a lot of locks that had signs on them stating they would be cut off. They have showers with Rituals shower gel/shampoo/conditioner. They also have Rituals hand soap and mouthwash by the sinks. Hand held hair dryers also available and plenty of towels when you walk in.\n\nOverall, an okay space to workout. It gets very crowded on weeknights, the class options are limited (or fill up fast), and no steam room. Electronics for spin classes need more attention. Didn't see an elevator. So expect to climb three levels of stairs to reach the top. They sell drinks and merch on the main level and sales team is right there to sell their plan to you.",

            "First time at Crunch with a day pass. I understand that it's in the gyms best interest to convert days passes to memberships, however I also don't like to be pressured into anything that I don't feel comfortable with. Any info about myself that I provided to the guy that was supposed to show me around felt like it wasn't good enough. Eventually he didn't show me around, maybe cos he sensed doubt in me converting.\n\nMy encounter at the lobby with the guy made me feel so uncomfortable that it affected me during my workout too. Honestly, I left the gym feeling pretty negative about Crunch. I usually feel empowered after a gym session, not after a mood ruining encounter. (I used to be a blink member but it got too crowded). Will be checking out nysc instead.\n\nI'm sure the guy didn't mean to make me feel uncomfortable since it's his job to understand why I'm here at crunch, however I'd suggest he watch the tone he uses, and the choice of words when responding, esp to answers that might not be what he's expecting. He comes off passive aggressive/ gaslighting\n\nSaid things like \"Are you trying to say you're better than me? Cos that's what it sounds like.\" And \"do you work for the CIA or something?\" I was so put off by a lot of things he was saying and felt like that's not the way I'd like to be spoken to as a potential client.\n\nAs someone who has worked in the retail and customer service industry for many years, I know how people can get-- I can assure you I am not one of those people. I'm patient and try to be as easy as possible since I know what it's like. With that being said, there are ways to circle back to a question if a customer is not answering it to your liking. Maybe his tactics works in car dealership sales where he can be harsh to get what's needed, but in gym sales where you are interacting with customers, and a customer who needs to feel comfortable at a gym-- his tactics doesn't work.\n\nPros:\n- Bathrooms are nice & spacious.\n-The classes looked cool, idk what it was tho but there were a lot of ppl with headphones\n\nCons:\n-Dumbbells only go up to 65.\n-Bench press area crowded + nearby weight barbell rack makes it hard to walk around there",

            "For the third time in a few months, had an issue with a trainer feeling like they own the space.\nToday a trainer asked if his client could work in. There is no rule about this and I never signed saying I agreed to this. I declined politely and the trainer tried to explain the circuit his client was doing, further wasting more time when he could have moved on. I then noticed he and his client were monopolizing 8 pieces of equipment.\nGranted the gym was not busy, but his act of placing towels on all the machines he wanted felt agressive.\n\nLook, I get training clients as I spent a decade as a private training for a private training gym. However, he asked politely to work in, I declined, that should have been the end. But the comments made to his client within ear shot of me were simply unprofessional and unnecessary. If crunch would like the policy to be mandatory to allow someone to work in, then give out new contracts stating as much and I will take my business elsewhere. Not that it matters to crunch to lose one member or not. But reign in your trainers. They aren't the gods they think they are.

So expect to climb three levels of stairs to reach the top. They sell drinks and merch on the main level and sales team is right there to sell their plan to you.",

            "First time at Crunch with a day pass. I understand that it's in the gyms best interest to convert days passes to memberships, however I also don't like to be pressured into anything that I don't feel comfortable with. Any info about myself that I provided to the guy that was supposed to show me around felt like it wasn't good enough. Eventually he didn't show me around, maybe cos he sensed doubt in me converting.\n\nMy encounter at the lobby with the guy made me feel so uncomfortable that it affected me during my workout too. Honestly, I left the gym feeling pretty negative about Crunch. I usually feel empowered after a gym session, not after a mood ruining encounter. (I used to be a blink member but it got too crowded). Will be checking out nysc instead.\n\nI'm sure the guy didn't mean to make me feel uncomfortable since it's his job to understand why I'm here at crunch, however I'd suggest he watch the tone he uses, and the choice of words when responding, esp to answers that might not be what he's expecting. He comes off passive aggressive/ gaslighting\n\nSaid things like \"Are you trying to say you're better than me? Cos that's what it sounds like.\" And \"do you work for the CIA or something?\" I was so put off by a lot of things he was saying and felt like that's not the way I'd like to be spoken to as a potential client.\n\nAs someone who has worked in the retail and customer service industry for many years, I know how people can get-- I can assure you I am not one of those people. I'm patient and try to be as easy as possible since I know what it's like. With that being said, there are ways to circle back to a question if a customer is not answering it to your liking. Maybe his tactics works in car dealership sales where he can be harsh to get what's needed, but in gym sales where you are interacting with customers, and a customer who needs to feel comfortable at a gym-- his tactics doesn't work.\n\nPros:\n- Bathrooms are nice & spacious.\n-The classes looked cool, idk what it was tho but there were a lot of ppl with headphones\n\nCons:\n-Dumbbells only go up to 65.\n-Bench press area crowded + nearby weight barbell rack makes it hard to walk around there",

            "For the third time in a few months, had an issue with a trainer feeling like they own the space.\nToday a trainer asked if his client could work in. There is no rule about this and I never signed saying I agreed to this. I declined politely and the trainer tried to explain the circuit his client was doing, further wasting more time when he could have moved on. I then noticed he and his client were monopolizing 8 pieces of equipment.\nGranted the gym was not busy, but his act of placing towels on all the machines he wanted felt agressive.\n\nLook, I get training clients as I spent a decade as a private training for a private training gym. However, he asked politely to work in, I declined, that should have been the end. But the comments made to his client within ear shot of me were simply unprofessional and unnecessary. If crunch would like the policy to be mandatory to allow someone to work in, then give out new contracts stating as much and I will take my business elsewhere. Not that it matters to crunch to lose one member or not. But reign in your trainers. They aren't the gods they think they are. And while you're at it, have them check out the form they instruct clients on. I routinely see them instructing clients in ways that will absolutely cause injury.",

            "I went today to use my first and only guest pass purchased via my own email address. they wouldn't let me in no matter what reasoning I gave them. They clearly are lying to my face. They said that because I had visited other locations in the past through ClassPass that I wasn't new to crunch. I was definitely new to this location. I would never get a gym membership without trying out the facilities. They wanted to charge me $35 for 30 minutes of basic exercise. my friend was inside waiting for me. She had a free guest pass and came down so I could use hers since they were giving me so much trouble. They would not let her use her pass on me either. I've tried to call HQ and their number is disabled. It's clear that crunch doesn't have any upper management and the facilities do whatever they feel. I'm hoping this problem can be escalated. They also refused to call upper management for me. The gym is small and facilities are a little bit dirty. The \"tour\" I was taken on took two minutes and didn't actually show me anything.\n\nEdit: through the grapevine I heard that the GM said he would have let me work out if I was nicer to him. Guess what. I was very nice in the beginning. Just more proof they discriminate and make their own rules.",

            "It is interesting how each Crunch location is extremely different from one another. Stopped by this location for convenience and that there was a spin class open at the time. The location is in the heart of midtown close to Herald Square and not too far from Times Square. The inside is brightly colored with neon colors. Head up to the second floor for the spin studio. I didn't realize the 'live swerve' classes meant you are watching an instructor virtually teaching the class \"live.\" There were barely 3 people taking the class and now I see why. The video screen would freeze up, sometimes no sound, and it took some time for an employee to check on this. The sad part is for any class you sign up for if you don't cancel 2 hours in advance there is a charge. However, its frustrating taking a class and then having technical difficulties. I'd probably avoid this kind of class again and stick to an instructor in person. They don't offer as much variety in classes at this location. This is more of a place to use the machines.\n\nHead up one more level to where all the main gym space is. There is another studio there which hosts classes. The remaining space includes all the machines, weights, punching bags, etc. The overall space and machines were decent and towels/wipes were consistently being picked up. In the evenings, the machines and weight areas can fill up quite a bit. Go mid-day on a weekday and you'll have a lot more space to workout. What's nice is there is a little lounge area outside the locker rooms where you can relax, charge your phone (bring your own cord), and perhaps have a snack. I sat here after my class to relax, but was interrupted by an employee hopping over to the seat next to be to flirt. Smh.\n\nThe women's locker room has a dry sauna, but no steam room. You must bring your own lock for the lockers. For some reason there were a lot of locks that had signs on them stating they would be cut off. They have showers with Rituals shower gel/shampoo/conditioner. They also have Rituals hand soap and mouthwash by the sinks. Hand held hair dryers also available and plenty of towels when you walk in.\n\nOverall, an okay space to workout.

            "Because it was pouring rain out and this gym is much closer than Blink Fitness, I came here last night to check out the NYU facilities while I stay at the dorms for the summer.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say that the reason I joined Blink in the first place is because of this gym's ridiculous hours. On weekdays it doesn't open until 8 am and I have to be at work by 9, like most of the other people looking to use the facility. On the weekends, it's even worse: it opens at NOON and closes at 8 pm. Wtf?\n\nAnyway, I came here for the first time and forced myself to work out in this stuffy space they call a gym. The place is a maze with a few machines thrown in. I walked into a room that looked like my high school gym with two small rows of machines- some rowing machines, some ellipticals, 5 bikes- and a small rack of weights. It was a laughable display. There's also a basketball court here I would never use and a pool I'm even less likely to take a dip in.\n\nI would tolerate this gym if it weren't for the hours, but the hours combined with the lack of equipment really does it for me. This place epitomizes a shitty college gym.",

            "I'm going to be brief because most of the other comments discuss Palladium in detail.\n\nGood:\n1. Clean for a university gym\n2. New equipment\n3. Basketball court\n4. Nice pool and always found it clean (few kids unlike Coles)\n5. Large stretching area in Aux gym\n6. Modern cardio room with tvs\n\nBad:\n1. CROWDED. Do not bother going between 5pm to 9pm. I can only imagine how much more crowded this gym will be when they tear down Coles next year.\n2. Small weight room. While it may be just as big as Coles, the fact that Palladium has less sports activities means that most people who come here are coming to workout\n3. Few showers and toilets. 4 toilets total in the men's locker rooms (1st and 2nd floor combined). Get ready to stand in line like at a ballgame.\n\n\nI think this gym was more meant to be used for the dorm residents above but since Coles has no A/C and also bought/developed so many dorms around Union Square this gym has become very popular. It's too crowded for me so I prefer Coles (plus, I play racquetball and tennis).\n\nIf you are the type that doesn't mind standing in line for a machine or toilet or working out 730am, then maybe Palladium will be okay for you.",
            "Good facilities, but shitty system in the sense you can't access the gym when the semesters change, for registration holds and advisor approvals. As a grad student my advisor and dept. needs time to process things. You guys really need to do something about this",
            "I have been a swimmer for several years. Palladium offers the ONLY NYU swimming pool. It is about 25mts long, and it's well kept. The thing is, recently (ever since NYU closed their other facility at J. coles) the pool is too crowded. Way, way overcrowded. This is why: half of the day is reserved for their swimming team. And the other half has to be shared amongst the 57,000+ thousand students and alumni who want to swim. Yup. You heard correctly. One pool, six lanes, 57,000 people. Meaning chances are everytime you go there (no matter the time of the day) you will have to share a lane with at least one other. In some ocassions, there are 6 people swimming at the same time in the same lane. And they all have different levels of expertise. It's bad.\nThe Gym is ok. It's got a climbing wall (which who need? But god bless)\nThe facilities are kept clean. And their schedules are updated daily on their website, which is much appreciated.",

And the other half has to be shared amongst the 57,000+ thousand students and alumni who want to swim. Yup. You heard correctly. One pool, six lanes, 57,000 people. Meaning chances are everytime you go there (no matter the time of the day) you will have to share a lane with at least one other. In some ocassions, there are 6 people swimming at the same time in the same lane. And they all have different levels of expertise. It's bad.\nThe Gym is ok. It's got a climbing wall (which who need?

When it's not too crowded, this is a state of the art gym.",
            "Because it was pouring rain out and this gym is much closer than Blink Fitness, I came here last night to check out the NYU facilities while I stay at the dorms for the summer.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say that the reason I joined Blink in the first place is because of this gym's ridiculous hours. On weekdays it doesn't open until 8 am and I have to be at work by 9, like most of the other people looking to use the facility. On the weekends, it's even worse: it opens at NOON and closes at 8 pm. Wtf?\n\nAnyway, I came here for the first time and forced myself to work out in this stuffy space they call a gym. The place is a maze with a few machines thrown in. I walked into a room that looked like my high school gym with two small rows of machines- some rowing machines, some ellipticals, 5 bikes- and a small rack of weights. It was a laughable display. There's also a basketball court here I would never use and a pool I'm even less likely to take a dip in.\n\nI would tolerate this gym if it weren't for the hours, but the hours combined with the lack of equipment really does it for me. This place epitomizes a shitty college gym.",

We had a wonderful/lengthy conversation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Also, the gym is large (7000 s.f.) and it was spotless. Another good thing is that the gym's hours are *very* extensive (6:00 a.m.-10:00 p.m. on M-F and 7:00 a.m.-9:00 p.m. on S/S). If we didn't have a (small) gym in our apartment complex, I'd be very tempted to join this one.\n\n**Note**: From 11-2 on Saturday 1/24, there will be a free Fitness Open House.

If we didn't have a (small) gym in our apartment complex, I'd be very tempted to join this one.\n\n**Note**: From 11-2 on Saturday 1/24, there will be a free Fitness Open House. It will include demos and raffle prizes. To register for the Open House, e-mail fitness@mannycantor.org or call 646-395-4281.",
            "This review is not for the gym. There's a lot that goes on at Manny Cantor Center from classes for kids, adults and older adults, to space that you can rent for events. It's a beautiful well-maintained building. It's very accessible to all, with great facilities. I've never had any rudeness from any of the guards. Everyone has been professional and friendly.",
            "The Manny Cantor Center, where I witnessed a boy become a man. (It was a bar mitzvah, you creep.) And it was a beautiful ceremony of acceptance into the Jewish community.\n\nThis was actually my first time at the Manny Cantor Center, but I found it to be quite pleasant. The security guards were friendly, the bathrooms were clean and nice, and most importantly, the event space up on the 6th floor was clean and well-lit, with an outdoor area that had a great view of the sunset.\n\nI'd recommend it for all your bar mitzvah needs.",
            "Great location for corporate parties, graduate schools, and more. I took some great photos of The 24th PILA Gala Event. Excellent Event. The Amy was awesome and so was the staff.",
            "Signed up for the gym here a month ago and Manny Cantor has been like a second home. It's on the small side but I've found the community here incredibly inclusive and genuinely non-judgmental. The mixed reviews on here seem misleading as they are for different services.\n\nPros: Price, I signed up for the $70/month family deal, which isn't bad at all given the convenience, service, classes offered, and knowing my money is going to a local, community center and not a chain with difficult contracts and surcharges. I signed up with Mallory and she was personable and friendly, giving me a in-depth tour while patiently answering all of my questions.\n\n-Classes are fun and small. So far, I've been to spinning and Zumba. Instructors were friendly and attentive.\n\n-Cleanliness is an A+, I go in the late morning or late at night. It's always spotless and cleaning stations are always stocked.\n\n-Music is great. It's an eclectic mix with songs like Daddy Yankee's \"Gasolina\" and chill, indie-pop. Whoever is making the playlists needs to be posting it online. The volume is on the low-side as many work out to their own music, but I've definitely stopped mid-workout to Shazam a song or two.\n\nCons: None! I'm a happy camper and love it!",
            "I had my wedding here in May, and it was such a lovely space! The ceremony and cocktail hour were done before sunset, and the event space was filled with light. The reception was after sunset, and with the lights out and candles everywhere, the room was dark and beautiful with the city lights outside. I was a little worried after being warned about being too loud, the neighbors complaining, etc, but nothing at all happened! Go talk to Amy (the rental manager) and tell her you want to hold your happy occasions there. You'll be doing a mitzvah!",
            "ABOUT THE FITNESS CENTER : DIRTY.\n\nI first subscribe more than a year ago. The place was brand new and very clean.\n\nNow, there is a lot more people, the restroom are filthy, the fitness room's floor is disgusting because people come from outside with their shoes : how am I suppose to put my face close to this floor where I can see hair, dirt, sweat spots ??!\n\nI've been many time to morning yoga classes, and they allow people to get in when they are late, during the meditation part, and even when it's super crowded. Disrespectful. People complained, and nothing was ever done.\n\nLast time I've been, it was very hot and there was no AC....... Out of order for two month !!!!!!\n\nSome teachers are amazing (especially Chintamani, Stephen, or Carolina) but I'm very angry against the management : There use to be classic amazing Pilates classes, and now there is only pretentious cardio Pilates, with marketing names like \"POP Pilates\".... which I find ridiculous and has nothing to do with Pilates, and everything to do with cardio and gym. Pilates has a purpose. And it's NOT to be fast. Please, there was plenty of other workout such as Zumba which includes cardio. AND EVEN IF sometimes a class is not overcrowded doesn't mean there is no need for this kind of class. Not everyone needs to be sore or risk a heart attack to feel thin.\n\n- You've lost me. -",
            "It's my gym because it's the closest place in my neighborhood and I like the people who run it, but there are more cons than pros lately.\n\nPros:\n-Price (take advantage of student pricing or family membership!)\n-clean most of the time\n-friendly people\n-decent cardio zone\n-It's in a neighborhood that desperately needs more gyms.\n\nCons:\n-nearly NO space for free-weight training. You can train in the room where group classes take place, but when there is class in session you're out of luck and have to work out in the small space next to cardio zone- there is space for 3 people comfortably, maybe 4. And have to watch out for people walking by.\n-NO towels\n-for the past 3 months, there have been no wet desinfecting wipes- only paper towels and some spray in bottles; combined with no towels... you get the idea (I don't understand why they wouldn't buy some more wipes.....)\n\nNeutral:\n-classes are ok most of the time\n-almost empty often, but crowded 6-8pm"

It's such a fantastic place to get in shape and work out. The owner Grace plus all the trainers are awesome (Amanda, Steph). So impressed by how they've managed through COVID and kept their members engaged and their community strong. At the outdoor classes they have spaced out boxes for people to distance, have plenty of sanitizer, masks worn while not in the boxes, wipes for the equipment etc. I have gotten in much better shape and I like that everyone is at different fitness levels. They give you modifications and help you out with your form. Looking forward to the actual gym opening and I'll add on to my review then :)"

            "For Starters:\nBLINK Williamsburg has had a terribly malfunctioning A/C system for my entire duration as a member there. As of November 7th, 2022, it's still broken.\nI've been a member there for over a year.\n\nEveryone all over the city is getting sick, as it happens EVERY Fall, especially post-Pandemic.\nBut BLINK would rather pocket our dues and \"yearly maintenance fees\", than to invest in everyone's safety. It only makes sense in the long run:\nKeep the members healthy and happy, so they keep coming back and paying their dues.\nBut they'd rather risk one of us calling the city to fine them, or even shut them down for spreading disease.\n\nNow... the reason why I made them refund me the several months I paid in advance on the spot:\nThey keep hiring CHEAP, Incompetent, Unprofessional \"managers\" to run the space. The latest of Several managers during my time there is no exception: SAMORA \"MO\" JOHNSON.\nHer very limited skillset caps at greeting members at the front desk. But she's really great at vaping while sitting in her office, where she thinks no one can see.\n\nThere was a sensitive issue that arose regarding a former employee.\nI did my best to communicate about it w/ \"Mo\". Only to the find out she had given me incorrect information.\nLong story short, she told me it was my privilege as a member to continue to bring the former employee as my guest. She explained that despite their parting of ways, that she had no issue regarding. Although I was prepared to hear \"No\" considering the circumstance, I was pleasantly surprised by her attempt at professionalism.\nBUT, not long after that conversation, \"Mo\" took back everything she told me. And since her communication skills are non-existent, she NEVER bothered to share any of that change w/ me. I found out through hearsay.\n\nShe also told the former employee, in Writing, that he was welcome to come back to the facility. But ONLY if he paid dues as a member.\nAnd so that's what he did.\nAnd guess what SAMORA JOHNSON did?\nShe denied him entry, even though the former employee was following Exactly what she told him in writing.\n\nBetween upper mgmt's blatant disregard for member safety, and their continued hiring of barely-skilled Budget managers, I hit my limit.\nI wasn't willing to smile politely and overlook their extreme shortcomings for another second. They found that out on the spot. Their corporate manager Michael included.\n\nAVOID this cesspool of germs and embarrassingly poor mgmt skills at all costs. Pay a few more extra dollars elsewhere, and save yourself the worthless trouble, and most importantly your Health.",

I went in and told the front desk that I wanted to cancel and I was aware that they might charge me for May 2022. This is a bank account I barely use and I've been out of the country and come back and they kept charging me even though I went over this a few times when I canceled and ask is this everything I need. Haven't been to the gym in a while and finally went in this week and I noticed this.

The gym has lots of space, plenty of cardio machines, and a decent amount of benches. The staff is also friendly and helpful. My only criticism of this place is that I think the layout is strange and has too much wasted space (for example, too much space is wasted on a seating area that no one uses). Further, if your focus is weight lifting then this is not the best place-- more space appears to be dedicated to cardio machines. Notwithstanding the strange layout, I think this is a great place.",
            "The weights/workout itself is honestly great - if that were the only consideration, this would be an easy 4-5 star, but the hot water and/or steam rooms have some kind of issue 1-2 times a month, consistently (and I'm not making this up - checking back on my archived emails, I've received 10 notifications about service interruptions in the last 6 months alone).\n\nTo be blunt, the fees Equinox charges are too high for that to be acceptable. Fix it.",

I love boxing - SUCH a good workout - and I wanted to try something new outside of Rumble. Gloveworx focuses on mitt work because they emphasize technique. The class sizes are kept pretty small so you always have 1 on 1 attention from an instructor.\n\nWe had a modified class and it still kicked my booty! When we were not doing mitt work we were nonstop doing bodyweight exercises - I hear in the studio they mix it up even further with climbers, etc; I was completely pooped after my 45 minute session.\n\nIt was sooo fun and I cannot wait to go back!",

Located in the Oculus - a bit of a trek for me but found a friend to do an intro class with me. Priced at $30, I was told that because there was two of us, we would be able to do a private session with a trainer, which we opted to do. Communication with Gloveworx was easy and quick, whether via email or phone. We got paired up with Micquel and he was great. He made sure we were properly stretched before starting our glove work. Our session focused on technique and he ensured that we were doing everything right before moving on and provided reminders when we left out a pivot or forgot to bring our hands back to blocking position. Ended our hour with some abs and cardio. Overall great session and looked like the facility was fully equipped.",

I am going to become a member! The class was great, I was sweating by the end of the warm up, the coaches pay attention to detail. The only thing I'll say is if your new to the fitness game it may be a little intimidating as there are lots of classes going ob at once.",
